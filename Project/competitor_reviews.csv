Apple iPhone 12 (64GB) - Black,"A powerful device with a stunning display and smooth performance. The camera quality is top-notch, but battery life could be improved.",Amazon
Apple iPhone 12 (64GB) - Black,"The iPhone 12 is the latest iteration of Apple's iconic smartphone series, and it continues to impress with its sleek design, powerful performance, and impressive camera capabilities. As a proud owner of the iPhone 12, I'd like to share my experiences and thoughts in this review.

Design and Build Quality (5/5):
Apple's design philosophy shines through in the iPhone 12. The flat-edged, aerospace-grade aluminum frame feels premium and comfortable to hold. The Ceramic Shield front cover offers extra durability, making me feel more confident in everyday use. The device is available in a variety of stunning colors, and the Super Retina XDR OLED display is simply brilliant, providing vibrant colors and deep blacks.

Performance (5/5):
Equipped with Apple's A14 Bionic chip, the iPhone 12 delivers top-notch performance. It handles multitasking, gaming, and demanding apps with ease. The device feels incredibly responsive, and I've never experienced any lag or slowdown, even with resource-intensive tasks.

Camera (4.5/5):
The iPhone 12 features a dual-camera system with a 12 MP wide and ultra-wide lens. The Night mode and Deep Fusion technology excel in low-light conditions, and the Smart HDR 3 makes every shot look stunning. However, compared to its more expensive sibling, the iPhone 12 Pro, it lacks a telephoto lens. Nonetheless, for the average user, the camera quality is more than satisfactory.

iOS 15 (5/5):
The iPhone 12 runs on iOS 15, which is Apple's latest and most feature-rich operating system. It's intuitive, secure, and keeps your device up-to-date. The App Library and widgets have been great additions, enhancing the user experience. Privacy features like App Tracking Transparency are commendable.

Battery Life (4/5):
While the iPhone 12's battery life is decent, it may not be the best among its competitors. It comfortably gets me through a full day of moderate use, but power users might need a top-up in the evening. However, the MagSafe wireless charging and support for fast charging (adapter sold separately) make it convenient to juice up quickly.

5G Connectivity (4.5/5):
With 5G support, the iPhone 12 is future-proofed for faster data speeds and improved connectivity. While 5G coverage may vary by region, it's an added bonus for those planning to keep their device for a few years.

Conclusion:
The iPhone 12 strikes an excellent balance between style and substance. It's a device that caters to the needs of a broad user base, offering impressive performance, a stunning display, and a camera that captures beautiful moments. iOS 15 brings a plethora of features to the table, and the device's design is nothing short of elegant. While battery life and the absence of a telephoto lens might deter some, for most users, the iPhone 12 is a fantastic choice, providing a premium Apple experience without the premium price tag.",Amazon
Apple iPhone 12 (64GB) - Black,"SUMMERY: As a first time iPhone user, I would say one should definitely buy iPhone ONLY for premium built & premium hardware (will talk later) while the whole iOS experience is pretty overrated. iPhones isn't any exceptionally fast with normal apps like YouTube, Insta etc, Android phones are equally snappy with them in 2022.

PROS:
1. Impressive hardware, the heptics, the autobrightness & otherwise highly ignored things in Android are way too perfectly executed in iPhone and it DOES make a big difference in user experience!!
2. The screen is AMAZING.. it doesn't have 90 or 120 hz refresh rate but it FEELS better than my Nord with 90 hz!!
3. A14 bionic promises years of performance ahead.
4. Battery life is somewhere in between good & great.
5.
6. The dimensions of phone, it's smaller than usual android phones and feels much more handy along with less weight.
7. Overall build quality is great.
8. Best audio output out there.
9. Long term support.

CONS:
1. SLOW CHARGING. 20 W only, you'll be jealous of 1/3rd price phones with 60 W charging. Yes that much high charging will effect health of battery but 20 W is way way too less, if Apple is such a legendary company they should have created a battery that can withstand decently fast charging while instead they just use slow charging to keep their battery's health.
2. Overy exhagerated software experience, reality is that Android is more user friendly with better gesture & commonsense options & settings & steps to do simple things. iOS looks pretty yes but UX engineers at Apple have really done a crappy job.. there's still no notification grouping in correct manner (its executed poorly), no proper homescreen customisation & just so so so many ""commonsense"" things are missing from iOS I can rant all day about it. Everything you can do in Android with a single click or swipe takes 2 swipes and then a click to do in iOS its SOOOOO ANNOYING. Like you want to clear a notification? Swipe and then click on clear. You want to open a notification? Swipe FIRST and then click open.. like wth????????
3. DON'T believe Apple fanboys who scream about speed, Android phones are equally snappy in performance today. There are split second app loading times in iOS also, just like in Android. And yeah iOS DOES HAVE occasional bugs too, apps taking too much time sometimes etc etc.
4. FaceID is nice but an in-fingerprint reader seems the best ID to me atleast, that's missing.
5. Ridiculously expensive accessories
6. Battery life is above good but not great.

In the end I would say iPhone, overall, does provide a better experience (mostly cuz of hardware only) but it's expensive. Do know that you're NOT buying a value-for-money phone at all, so buy it only if you can afford it without much difficulty.",Amazon
Jabra Elite 3 Bluetooth,"Pros:
1. Decent packaging.
2. Good build quality. The case doesn't feel premium, but doesn't feel cheap either.
3. Pairs effortlessly. Mono mode is as simple as putting one side in the case.
4. Decent sound quality. No jitter at high/low frequency.
5. Hear through functionality is wonderful. You also hear your own voice when you're in a call so you won't be shouting when talking.
6. Jabra sound app is amazing. All the necessary controls are available and work very well.
7. Type C charging port.

Cons:
1. The ability to pair both sides independently should have been provided. I sometimes use my mobile and laptop, both at the same time and have to switch between calls.
2. The white noise doesn't go away. It's not an issue while listening to music, but it's just there and is a little annoying.
3. Should have had more colour options.

Verdict:

The product was delivered within a day. The box contains the earbuds in its case, 3 sets of silicon plugs, a small USB-C cable and documentation. These don't come charged in the box so you'll have to wait for a while.
Pairing this was straight forward. I definitely recommend downloading the Jabra Sound app and tune the sound to your liking through the 6 band equalizer. Also, the registration for warranty can be done on the app itself.

Jabra doesn't advertise this as an earphone built for music, or audiophile grade.
That's a good starting point.
These earbuds give you a good build quality, efficient connectivity and above average sound quality at a very, very good price.
My requirement is to be able to take calls on the move and casually listen to music on YouTube sometimes. It does all of that very well.
I can't compare it with audiophile earbuds because it's a different league. But at this price (brought for 3999), it clearly beats the competition.",Amazon
Jabra Elite 3 Bluetooth,"This one is really good and better sound quality. The 6 mm driver well performed at road side surrounded. I fear to before get earbuds because the driver size is 6 mm only they performed sound is very low but I was wrong. The sound is enough and enough. Comfortable to fit. Than sound plus app one of the good thing. The app here many of the modes netural,bass boost, treble boost,vocal,voice, energized, customised mode. I am preferred treble and bass boost melody songs and treble combination is lovely everytime. Bass is also good but I hear only melody songs so I don't use bass mode.
Advantages
1.Premium look
2.buds quality is well
3.present in hearthrough mode
4.jabra sound plus app
5.customize sound
6.bulid in alexa assistant
7.better sound quality
8.mono buds performed well
Disadvantages
1.buds case comes with normal quality. I am not satisfied case quality.
2.Sound latency in while playing game
Over all usage is very good. Minimum level disadvantages are present but it's not a matter the sound and quality buds is well",Amazon
Jabra Elite 3 Bluetooth,"I am writing this review after more than a week from the day these buds were delivered. Personally, I would recommend the lilac color - it looks great in pics and even better in person. The packaging feels premium and 2 additional pairs of ear-tips (apart from the pre-fitted ones) are provided along with a type-C cable which feels premium too.

In terms of sound, these are amazing and they sound really good for the price and the audio output is very clear. Personally I would recommend using it with the ""Jabra Sound+"" app that is available on Playstore using which minor tweaks can be done to the sound output and even the sound graph can be modified. The hear-through feature, which even though felt like a gimmick to me, is a welcoming feature at this price point. All in all - great sounding buds for the price.

And coming to the call quality - something Jabra is known for, these buds did not disappoint and the call quality is clear and the other party was able to hear me clearly and I did not face any issues during calls.

One con would be that the top of the case felt felt a little shaky/flimsy while opening/closing but again these might be an issue with the particular unit I received and is clearly not a deal breaker to most people.

So to sum it up - these are great buds for the price and I would definitely recommend these over the overpriced OnePlus buds which sound mediocre and just use brand name to justify the price. If you can get these Jabra buds for under 2800, then go for it!!!",Amazon
Jabra Elite 3 Bluetooth,"The latest iteration from Jabra looked promising.
But boy did it disappoint me.
The main issue with these earphones are the prominent hissing sound (white noise) it produces almost all the time. Even if you play music at high volumes, you can hear a hiss in the background and it is really annoying.
I thought it was the issue with my pair and got them replaced. But the new pair had the same issue too. So it is an issue with almost all pairs.

It is sad because other than that these earphones have a lot of potential. The sound quality is bang on with rich bass that is not muddy. The mids and highs were warm and clear. The build is not the best especially in case of the case (ಠﭛಠ), the lid is wiggly and feels cheap. The fit was good and secure but felt like you entered a vaccum chamber.
Overall a solid pair but completely destroyed because of one single major issue.",Amazon
Jabra Elite 3 Bluetooth,"Exelent pair of earbuds, easy to use and setup, exelent noise cancellation, comfortable to wear, stay in place, very good design,very stylish charging box/case.

Oneplus Bullets Z2 Bluetooth Wireless in Ear Earphones with Mic,"If you're on the lookout for a solid pair of wireless earphones, the OnePlus Bullets Z2 might just catch your eye. I've been using them for a while, and here's my honest take on what they have to offer.

Connectivity & Ease of Use:

Let’s start with one of the essentials—connectivity. The OnePlus Bullets Z2 nails it with seamless Bluetooth connectivity that just works. Pairing them with my phone was as simple as it gets, and once connected, they stay that way without any annoying drops. The button placement on the neckband is intuitive, and after a day or two of use, I could easily control playback without needing to glance down, thanks to muscle memory. It’s the kind of convenience you don’t realize you need until you have it.

Sound Quality - Balanced Yet Personal:

Now, onto the sound quality. As someone who values a balanced sound signature, I found the Z2 to be a great match for my taste. Whether I'm listening to some mellow jazz, electronic beats, or even rock, the sound remains well-rounded and crisp. The highs, mids, and lows don't overpower each other, making it perfect for those who don't want their ears blasted with bass or overwhelmed by treble.

That said, sound quality is a subjective experience, and preferences can vary widely. If you're a bass head looking for those earth-shaking lows, you might find these a tad restrained. But if, like me, you appreciate a balanced output across genres, these will hit the right notes for you.

Battery Life & Quick Charging - A Week of Peace:

Battery life is another highlight. With moderate use—think about 1-2 hours daily—you can stretch a single charge to last an entire week. Even if you’re a heavy listener, using them for 6-8 hours straight, they can hold up for around 2-3 days before needing a recharge. And the quick charge feature is a lifesaver—just 10 minutes of charging gets you 2-4 hours of extra playtime, which is perfect for those “oops, I forgot to charge them” moments.

Gaming & Low Latency - Smooth Experience:

I spend a fair bit of time playing games like BGMI, and the low latency mode on the Bullets Z2 makes a noticeable difference. There's minimal lag between the visuals and the audio, which makes for a much more immersive gaming experience. It's not just about the sound being clear; it's also about it being on time, and these earphones deliver that pretty well.

Comfort & Passive Noise Isolation:

Comfort is key when it comes to neckbands, and the Z2 doesn’t disappoint. They come with multiple earbud sizes, so you can pick the one that fits snugly for you. While there’s no active noise cancellation (ANC) here, you can achieve a decent level of passive noise isolation by choosing the right ear tips. This makes a noticeable difference in cutting out background noise during commutes or at the office.

App Experience & Annoying Blinking Light:

Now, onto a couple of quirks. The Bullets Z2 uses the HeyMelody app, which offers additional features like custom sound settings. However, my unit just wouldn’t connect with the app, which was a bummer. So, any fancy tweaks you could make through the app were out of my reach, and I had to rely solely on the default Bluetooth pairing. While everything worked smoothly once connected, I feel like I missed out on some customization options that might have enhanced my experience.

Another thing that bugged me was the small white light that blinks when the neckband is connected to a device. It might not seem like a big deal, but if you’re using the earphones in a dark room or while lying down, that blinking light can be pretty distracting. Plus, it probably drains the battery a bit, albeit a small amount. A simple option to turn this off in the app would’ve been a nice touch.

Final Thoughts - A Solid Pick for Most, with Room for Improvement:

Overall, the OnePlus Z2 delivers where it matters—good sound quality, reliable connectivity, and battery life that won’t have you constantly reaching for the charger. It’s not perfect, especially with the blinking light and app connectivity issues, but those are minor compared to the solid performance it offers. Plus, with the quick-charge feature and low-latency gaming experience, it’s hard not to appreciate the value you get.

If you’re looking for a reliable neckband that blends style, comfort, and balanced audio, the OnePlus Bullets Z2 is definitely worth considering. It might not satisfy those who crave earth-shattering bass, but for most listeners, it's a worthy contender at its price point.",Amazon
Oneplus Bullets Z2 Bluetooth Wireless in Ear Earphones with Mic,"There is nothing wrong with the looks of the Bullets Z2, they are actually quite decent looking. They are just a neckband, and this is what neckbands look like, and we have made our peace with it. The middle part is a thicker, slightly more stiff, U shaped-silicon band, with two chunky pill-shaped units at the end. The wires stem from these pills and have earbuds on the end. One of these pill-shaped units houses the battery, while the other has control options and the USB Type C port on the side. You get volume buttons on this control unit and a multi-function play/pause button. The battery unit has the OnePlus branding and the logo, while the volume buttons are highlighted in red.

The earbuds on the end are pretty standard, with eartips on one side and a flat back with magnets. When the buds are attached together, they will simply stop playing the audio, which you can resume once you put them back in. The Bullets Wireless Z2 are quite light and can be worn around the neck all day without ever feeling like a burden. The material used is quite skin-friendly and feels quite sturdy as well. It also comes with an IP55 rating.
Pairing the OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 is a pretty fuss-free process. All you have to do is press and hold the play/pause button, and the buds will go into pairing mode. You can then look up the buds in the list of Bluetooth pairings on your device and connect the buds. Once connected, the Bullets Z2 will connect to your phone automatically once you put them on.

You get the usual volume buttons on the buds and another button in the middle in terms of controls. Now instead of simply sharing the command load amongst its button comrades, OnePlus has put all the burden on this one button in the middle. Apart from the usual pairing/play/ pause/ call receiving/ call ending functions (which are already a lot for a single button), OnePlus has also made it responsible for changing tracks. You have to press the button twice to skip to the next song and thrice to go back to the last song. It may all sound simple but can actually be chaotic in practice as you have to keep track of how many times you have pressed that tiny button before the command is completed.

The OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 comes with the biggest drivers seen on a pair of OnePlus earphones- 12.4mm. The fact that OnePlus is offering such big drivers for under two thousand rupees is a major plus point for the buds. The earbuds support two audio codecs, SBC and AAC.

As for the audio performance, the Bullets Wireless Z2 are pretty loud and come with plenty of bass, something that seems to be every brand’s audio formula in the budget segment. While this kind of signature sound gives the audio some faux body, it actually fails to deliver what the audio is truly supposed to sound like.
If you are someone looking for a pair of earphones that offer balanced sound, then you might not like the sound profile that the Bullets Wireless Z2 offer as they lack balance, majorly.

That said, if you are someone who likes bass-heavy audio output and do not mind if some bass sneaks into your mids, then the OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 will definitely be your cup of tea.

The OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 were pretty good in terms of call quality. We could hear the speaker clearly, and we heard no complaints whatsoever regarding our audio quality while using the buds. As the buds fit deep into your ear canals, they offer really good passive noise cancellation.

They come with big 12.4 mm drivers, offer really long battery life, have a bass-heavy signature sound, and have a really solid build. But because the earbuds are really bass-heavy, they lack balance, and for those who like to listen to melodious or classical music, these might not be a great option.
The Bullets Wireless Z2 also face some heat from the likes of Oppo Enco M32 and the Realme Buds 2, which are priced in the same vicinity. The OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 are actually a great proposition for the price; you only need to have a liking for bass.",Amazon
Oneplus Bullets Z2 Bluetooth Wireless in Ear Earphones with Mic,"The OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 ANC is a budget-friendly neckband with strong bass, decent ANC, and a comfortable design. It offers up to 28 hours of battery life, fast charging, and an IP55 rating for dust and water resistance. While the bass-heavy sound may not suit everyone, it’s a solid choice for casual listeners.",Amazon
Oneplus Bullets Z2 Bluetooth Wireless in Ear Earphones with Mic,"Good quality, little bigger the end of the neck band because of a bigger battery. Sound and noise cancelation better than previous model. Ear tips smaller and lighter, for me hold really good even running, better bass and treble.",Amazon
Oneplus Bullets Z2 Bluetooth Wireless in Ear Earphones with Mic,"Bought these for the 2-3 hours a week I am at the gym and the battery life is good. The fit is good and the design is nice in my opinion, very slim and light weight. Despite the magnetic connection of the earbuds being the only way to power down the device this has not been an issue, they snap together and power down flawlessly. They are comfortable and the connection is the fastest I've ever seen and they connect to my S24 within a few seconds after separating the magnetic backs of the earbuds. Sound quality is decent, but the price and functionality has surpassed expectations as I've been using them for over 5 months and I've only had to charge them maybe once every other week for like 30 minutes.",Amazon
Oneplus Bullets Z2 Bluetooth Wireless in Ear Earphones with Mic,Ive trouble finding earphones that fit properly in my odd shaped ears. The neckband was chosen so I don't have to keep picking up my earphone off the floor!,Amazon
Oneplus Bullets Z2 Bluetooth Wireless in Ear Earphones with Mic,"The OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 earphones offer impressive value for their price, delivering solid sound quality with punchy bass, thanks to the 12.4mm drivers. The 30-hour battery life is excellent, and the quick charge feature is a lifesaver, providing hours of listening time with just a few minutes of charging.

Pros:

Sound quality: The bass is powerful without being overwhelming, and the mids and highs are clear.
Battery life: 30 hours of playtime is outstanding, and the 10-minute quick charge provides a substantial boost.
Comfort: The ergonomic design and lightweight build make them comfortable for extended wear.
IP55 rating: Water and sweat resistance make them suitable for workouts and outdoor activities.

The OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 earphones are a fantastic option for those seeking budget-friendly earphones with excellent battery life, comfortable fit, and impressive sound quality for the price. While they may not have all the bells and whistles of more expensive models, their solid performance and value proposition make them a great choice for everyday use.",Amazon

I also bought a license plate mount for the backup camera, and I bought a different kind of mount for the head unit so that I could hook it into my AC vent (getting it to stick to my dashboard was not going to work longer term with a car that sits outside in the Texas summers).

Long story short, it connected to my phone almost immediately, and it works very well with Android Auto. And the backup camera is also very good (my wife was impressed with the image and said it is better then the built in backup camera in her Honda CRV).

So, overall, very happy to rate it 5 stars. Assuming it holds up, worth the money spent and time it took to setup and install.

Here are some specific pros and cons and considerations:

Pros:
* It does what it says it will do and it does it at a very reasonable price.
* Very bright, crisp images on the screen.

Cons (these are all minor):
* Touch screen seems an iota slow. Not terrible, just about 1/5th of a second slower than my phone, for comparison.
* Built in speakers are OK, but not great and certainly not built for high vol.
* Cord for the backup camera was about a foot short for how I wanted to route it, but it was long enough to route it under my front seat (which was my second choice).
* Instruction manual gets a B-. Far better than most instructions manuals coming out of China, but could be better.

Considerations:
* Backup camera installation is not hard if you know what you are doing and are comfortable pulling wires through cars, etc. There are some good videos on YouTube. Watch them carefully and think through how you are going to do it before you start. If you have the correct tools and are comfortable doing this kind or work, should take you about an hour at most.
* You likely will need to drill a small hole for the backup camera wire. Be thoughtful about how to do that (there may be two walls you have to punch through), and use grommets or tape to make sure the sharp edges where you drill the hole don't eventually slice through the wire's insulation from the vibration of driving.
* Also have about 10 small 'zip ties' for securing the wires so they don't get pinched some day.
* As noted above, I do recommend a different way to mount the head unit than what comes with the system, and a different camera mount.
* Lastly, you are going to have some cables running to the unit, so have a plan to manage them so they are not in your way while you drive and become a hazard or look unseemly.",Amazon
PASLDA Wireless Carplay Adapter,"Fast shipping, arrived as described. Setup was super easy and connects by Bluetooth quickly. I put it in my 2007 Ford Focus and works like a charm. I use mine over the car radio, no complaints on sound. It’s not Ultra High Def sound using this method but I have no complaints. I am thinking of buying one for another old work car that I have.",Amazon
PASLDA Wireless Carplay Adapter,"This is exactly what I needed! I love playing music on my phone in the car, but my car is old enough that it doesn't have a Bluetooth connection feature, and the regular phone speaker doesn't go loud enough for me. This allowed me to be able to play my music and hook it into the car speakers through the cigarette lighter port. It has also been great when I am driving, instead of having to try and look at my phone at stop lights I can easily see this screen out of the corner of my eye on the dash to make sure I am still on thr right path. In addition to that, it can read my texts to me, and I can click the speaker button and talk to respond to texts handsfree. 10/10 reccomend! I feel like it has made me a safer more efficient driver, and it is so easy to use. Just plug in to the car, press the power on button, and open Bluetooth screen on your phone and select the car play option and you are ready to go!! Only piece of advice I have is to stick the mount on a warm day. I messed up not thinking about it, and stuck it on a 20 degree day. It didn't stick, and fell so I had to buy more adhesive for it. As long as you don't make the mistake I did you will be fine. It is a great quality product, easily fits on dash board, and makes my life so much easier.",Amazon
PASLDA Wireless Carplay Adapter,"After purchasing two of these units from a different seller and returning both due to issue with the audio I found this product to be in great working order.

""Wireless"" is a misleading name for this product. It does connect wirelessly to your phone via Android Auto or Apple Carplay. But there are a lot of wires involved! there is a separate wire for power, auxiliary audio, and the backup camera. You will likely have to drill a hole in your truck/hatch for the backup camera wire. And connecting the camera wire to your reverse light is not intuitive or easy. You have to strip a little of the wire, find the positive wire of the reverse light, and connect the two wires in some way. I put the camera wire into the housing of the light fixture and made the connection that way. The instructions are super basic and leave lots of room for interpretation.

Once I installed the camera and screen, hid the the wires under the plastic paneling and floor mats I was pleased to find that the screen works great. The functionality is just what I was looking for. Once I connected my phone to the unit via Android Auto I was able to use my apps via the touch screen. And every time I gat in the car my phone automatically connects within 30-60 seconds.

The backup camera is low quality. It works fine in daylight but is pretty much worthless at night.

A note on the audio: you have to select ""auxiliary"" in the audio settings for it to play through your car speakers. It won't automatically play through the aux cord when you plug it in. But I only had to do this once, audio plays through the aux cord automatically every time I get in the car.

Bottom line: you get what you pay for. This is a very affordable upgrade to your old car.",Amazon

Apsara A4 Size Long Notebook ,"I ordered what was advertised as a pack of 12 Apsara A4 Longbook29.7x21 Pages 96 Single Line, but to my disappointment, I only received 01.

I strongly advise others to double-check before placing an order. Be cautious!

Baybee Run Battery Operated Jeep,Nice packaging...The product is of good qauality..working really good.,Amazon
Baybee Run Battery Operated Jeep,This is an amazing product. We have tried this and my baby loves thid,Amazon
Baybee Run Battery Operated Jeep,"Pros:
- Solid built quality and premium feel. Not any kind of cheap/thin plastics you normally find.
- Item arrived in a very good packaging. Easy to assemble. The instruction manual is pretty clear and the assembly took about 30 min.
- We have only used remote controlled driving as of now and it works great. Easy control and works as intended.
- Works on tiled indoors, outdoor with interlocks as well as lawns.
- It seems you could drive around 45min-1hour with a full charge though we haven't allowed battery to go down to lowest level yet.

Cons:
- At this price, the car is missing a few bling. Doors are not openable. No rear lights. No Aux/USB ports for music, only the built-in boring tones.

Overall, my kid loves it and I'd give it a 4/5.",Amazon

Blue Heaven Cookie & Souffle Matte Lipstick,"I ordered this and i was impressed by the packaging. And when I tried the lipstick the first wand it felt so lightweight and airy, just like mousse.

Might have to reapply after 7 hours. Overall great product.",Amazon

SIHOO High Back Home Office Chair,"I have ordered 2 Sihoo M57 chairs and I am amazed by the overall experience.
The package was delivered on time, packaging was awesome and clean. The user manual has minimal 7-8 step process which can be followed to assemble the chair in approx 20-30 minutes.

The comfort level is great. The mesh is breathable so say goodbye to your sweaty pants.

The build quality is great. Steel and good plastic would make sure that it is durable. Handrests are quite accommodating and comfy with a little but soft plastic.

Con- Only a minor issue that i want to mention, the hansrest and neck support parts fumble a little but that is not a major issue as the chair is far better than any other chair brands in India.

As per my research, only Steelcase and Herman Miller offer better chairs but those are mostly not available in India and even if some models are available, they are like above 40-50k for a normal model. The HM that I liked was 1.2lacs 😂 so dropped the idea till i open my own business or become CEO of a firm 🤟🏻😎",Amazon
SIHOO High Back Home Office Chair,"The quality of the product is better than the other chairs sold in India with the same price range. Assembling the product do give a sense of achievement. Also helps u see each parts used and its quality.
I would recommend it if it is in ur budget even with its caveats.

Pros
1) lumbar support is padded and customizable. The reason i preferred this over others.
2) Being mesh do actually keeps u cooler. I tend to not need my AC, Only a fan can keep u comfortable.
The mesh don't irritate the skin. Mesh is of good quality
3) It doesn't creak at all (atleast my unit). Is sturdy even with the recliner. testament to its quality.
4) Only Chair i found sold in India with good Mesh quality being all mesh within the 15k budget. The
local brands are all selling it above 20k. Please keep this price.

Cons
1) Mesh seat even tho being flexible will not be as comfortable as a fabric cushion for some people. I am
not sure if it will sag by time. I work more than 12 hrs on the chair. My butt do feel numb but it is still
endurable for long use.
2) The armrest do have some wobble coz its can be adjusted. dont feel like its going to break but could
improve on it. Also i know its not 5D adjustable but wish the arms could be more narrower for me
since i am thin.
3) the leg arms do have edges that is not comfortable if i keep my foot on it. I can feel the metal blunt
edge. Could have some padding on it or make the design smother on the corner edge.
4) The recliner spring, I am not sure if the tension knob on the bottom even works or not coz i dont feel
any tension change on the recliner",Amazon
SIHOO High Back Home Office Chair,"Chair is built with good quality material. Back and bottom seat is made up of durable mesh resulting in good ventilation.

SIHOO High Back Home Office Chair,"Product is too good and quality is top notch it beats 30-40k range chair ,very comfort easy to fix .screw driver included with nuts .additional one screw is more .comfort is very very good not sure on the longevity as the chair is made of nylon strings or may be some other material .awesome quality of plastic and metal base .consort closed eyes who wants to do work from home and sit for longer hours .invest in your back",Amazon
SIHOO High Back Home Office Chair,"I generally review as soon as I bought the product in my initial impression

No doubt the product is comfortable and looks premium but here are some additional challenges.

After 6 months, I started noticing the oil leaking from Sihoo Chair and I emailed Sihoo for the same. There is no support in India.
The support I hot is from Hong Kong China.
They sent the Shocker and It caused so much trouble.
1 - your documents are required as KYC since the shipment you are receiving is from China. In my case they put my first name only for which I have to struggle alot, finally I was asked courier service to provide declaration of the name Sihoo added to the package
2 - The Product is stuck at Custom duty, when I reached out to Sihoo, they I need to clear that not them.
3 - despite of multiple follow up after that, no one is willing to listen in Sihoo
4 - Courier service is another trouble here, They keep on calling until your documents are not approved by their team and the custom duty fees is not cleared and because they charge you per day basis till the product is delivered to you ( beyond 3 days).

In short, Support is pathetic and if you come accross any issue, you are done.",Amazon

SIHOO High Back Home Office Chair,"I was a little concerned that i would struggle with the build of the chair. It was very well thought out by company including providing gloves to use. This comes in handy when using the provided screwdriver to tighten all the screws.

One issue i did was was the casters are difficult to put in. However once i aligned the caster so that it was straight i was able to use my what to whack it...a bit painful on the hand but the chair is so strudy that its worth a 1 minute discomfort. Worst case let one of your kids do that part.

All in all happy with the comfort of the chair and the setup of the head rest which is quite flexible. Super comfortable and the color (i purchased the grey one) is very nice a little change from black.",Amazon

But babies have more space to crawl and play, it is a safe option for keeping babies when guardians are busy. Only point missing in design is that the vertical middle rods should be cushioned like the upper horizontal ones. My baby bumped his head on the vertical rod and it caused a small red contusion.

I looking for a slim low weight good configuration laptop for a while now for work, but then one of my friend suggest me the Lenovo Ideapad Slim 5, at first I was hesitant but when I saw the reviews on YouTube for it I was instantly hooked to it. I really like the way the laptop is designed slim and compact. And it’s performance is perfect for my day to day use. Moreover the screen is so good to watch my favourite shows and YouTube videos.

The slim and compact design of the laptop helps me carry it around almost anywhere with hassle. I’ve also used it for light gaming!!!! SUPER HAPPY to have the Idea pad Slim 5 and excited to be part of the Lenovo family.

 Points to know before you purchase Lenovo laptop on Amazon stores:

Colour: CloudVerified Purchase
1. You don't get one year warranty with the laptop as it is mentioned with the item. But Amazon from its end nominally give you a warranty for one year which won't be reflected in Lenovo Vantage. In order to get your justiciable warranty, you need to struggle a lot with Lenovo. They will ask you 1000 and 100 proofs. If you are not concerned about warranty then you can buy this laptop.
2. This laptop doesn't support Alexa. I tried but I failed. Finally I found that this laptop is not compatible with Alexa.
3. There are many 2024 year manufactured laptops are there. Buy a good one. If you still want this 2023 August manufacture model, then go ahead and buy. It can be a good museum piece in your home.
4. Finally it is your choice to buy headache and tension or a good advanced model of some other company.

I got this laptop for everyday use and light office applications like PowerPoint and Excel. It’s super lightweight and I can carry it anywhere I need to without hurting my shoulders.

Pros:
Lightweight
Great Screen
No lag when using most applications

Cons:
Can’t really play any games on it. But have a gaming system for those needs.

 Fantastic Phone - Best Compact Phone Period.

Colour: GreenSize: 256GBPattern Name: PhoneVerified Purchase
This is probably the best 6.1 inch phone your money can buy and most premium phone in android. I am sure it will beat apple too in value for money.
Got this phone for 50,800 after all the discount and exchanging my Oneplus 7T.

* Build quality is just strong with aluminum frame and gorilla glass victus on both sides.
* Display is full HD and is very pleasing to use. This is the best brightness I have experienced with 1750 nits. 120hz makes the user experience so fluid.
* Storage of 256GB with UFS 4.0 and 8GB RAM makes the phone usage buttery smooth.
* Cameras are top notch and software does a great job is delivering brilliant pictures.
* BATTERY !! Yay this is the best part of this phone and what it can deliver with combination of QCOM Snadragon 8 gen 2 and 3900mah battery. The battery can most likely last 2 days for most common use cases.
* Software experience has been improved with one UI and feels great. The updates are provided for 5 years which is longest in android world.

Overall definitely recommend this phone as its the best compact android phone in 2023 your money can buy especially with all the discounts its pure value for money.
Samsung nailed it with S23 series this year. Kudos !!

 Compact and sensible smartphone
Reviewed in India on 9 May 2023
Colour: GreenSize: 256GBPattern Name: PhoneVerified Purchase
The Samsung Galaxy S23 is an excellent choice for anyone who's looking for a one-handed and compact smartphone. The ease of using with one hand and the screen area available for use is just about right.
I have listed some points from my usage after 2 months of use - it involves everything except gaming.

What's good about the device?
1. Communications - Network reception is really good. It is very power efficient in 4G mode with SOT more than 8 hours.
Wifi, NFC, casting, Samsung DeX- all of these work reliably well.
5G Communication is also excellent but the SOT with active 5G use drops to around 6 hours.

2. Display - it is good, but it would have been even better if the panel would have been the same from S23 Ultra.

3. Battery life - excellent with normal usage. With calls, 4G and WiFi, and lots of streaming, it easily lasts a day. SOT of 9-10 hours can be obtained quite easily when connected to WiFi. On 5G network, obviously it'll drop off a bit.

4. Performance - Excellent so far. No issues whatsoever.

5. Samsung Pay - excellent features, easy to use, and I don't need to carry my wallet anymore.

6. Camera - takes excellent pictures. Even the night mode works very well.

What's not so good?
1. Charger is missing in the box. OEMs who actually care about sustainability should not copy Apple (or others) and it's ridiculous decisions.

2. Display - sometimes the display seems unresponsive in various apps. Although it is easily fixed by switching between apps or worst case, restarting the app. Not sure if it is hardware related or app related. Not all apps have this issue.
When it happens, it's quite annoying.

However, at the end of the day, I'm happy to have a compact and reliable phone with good network reception and excellent battery life!

 True flagship performance and excellent overall with a (hopefully) temporary glitch.
Reviewed in India on 8 March 2023
Verified Purchase
The battery backup is very poor at present. Tried tweaking multiple things including changing the performance profile to ""Light"" instead of ""Standard"". That seems to help a bit. But, it's nowhere near the 7-8 hours of screen on time reported in most Youtube reviews and user experience.

My old device was a Xiaomi Redmi K20 Pro, which I exchanged for this. It had more than 100 apps installed and even with that the battery was pretty good. In this phone I have installed only a very few apps until now, so very surprised by the battery life.

Many online forums including Samsung Members app have multiple reports of the same. Seems like its after the Feb 2023 update, hope it'll be fixed in their next update.(fingers crossed)

Other than that it has been a very satisfying and really good experience with butter smooth animations and quick app loading, awesome screen and multimedia content from apps like Netflix is a treat to watch on it. And the ""Expert raw"" app is a beast at grabbing unprecedented level of detailing. Even if I use jpg output from it, it's still far ahead than the regular Camera app in it. However, the default camera app is also pretty solid. The camera images and videos in low light is pretty good.

Another thing I liked is that most of the Samsung apps(that comes by default) which is not needed can be uninstalled.

Note: One thing I learnt the hard way: If you're applying a screen guard/tempered glass afterwards, do register your fingerprint again for best detection.

I got this laptop for everyday use and light office applications like PowerPoint and Excel. It’s super lightweight and I can carry it anywhere I need to without hurting my shoulders.

Pros:
Lightweight
Great Screen
No lag when using most applications

Cons:
Can’t really play any games on it. But have a gaming system for those needs.

I looking for a slim low weight good configuration laptop for a while now for work, but then one of my friend suggest me the Lenovo Ideapad Slim 5, at first I was hesitant but when I saw the reviews on YouTube for it I was instantly hooked to it. I really like the way the laptop is designed slim and compact. And it’s performance is perfect for my day to day use. Moreover the screen is so good to watch my favourite shows and YouTube videos.

The slim and compact design of the laptop helps me carry it around almost anywhere with hassle. I’ve also used it for light gaming!!!! SUPER HAPPY to have the Idea pad Slim 5 and excited to be part of the Lenovo family.

 Points to know before you purchase Lenovo laptop on Amazon stores:
Reviewed in India on 29 July 2024
Colour: CloudVerified Purchase
1. You don't get one year warranty with the laptop as it is mentioned with the item. But Amazon from its end nominally give you a warranty for one year which won't be reflected in Lenovo Vantage. In order to get your justiciable warranty, you need to struggle a lot with Lenovo. They will ask you 1000 and 100 proofs. If you are not concerned about warranty then you can buy this laptop.
2. This laptop doesn't support Alexa. I tried but I failed. Finally I found that this laptop is not compatible with Alexa.
3. There are many 2024 year manufactured laptops are there. Buy a good one. If you still want this 2023 August manufacture model, then go ahead and buy. It can be a good museum piece in your home.
4. Finally it is your choice to buy headache and tension or a good advanced model of some other company.

Colour: GreenSize: 256GBPattern Name: PhoneVerified Purchase
This is probably the best 6.1 inch phone your money can buy and most premium phone in android. I am sure it will beat apple too in value for money.
Got this phone for 50,800 after all the discount and exchanging my Oneplus 7T.

* Build quality is just strong with aluminum frame and gorilla glass victus on both sides.
* Display is full HD and is very pleasing to use. This is the best brightness I have experienced with 1750 nits. 120hz makes the user experience so fluid.
* Storage of 256GB with UFS 4.0 and 8GB RAM makes the phone usage buttery smooth.
* Cameras are top notch and software does a great job is delivering brilliant pictures.
* BATTERY !! Yay this is the best part of this phone and what it can deliver with combination of QCOM Snadragon 8 gen 2 and 3900mah battery. The battery can most likely last 2 days for most common use cases.
* Software experience has been improved with one UI and feels great. The updates are provided for 5 years which is longest in android world.

Overall definitely recommend this phone as its the best compact android phone in 2023 your money can buy especially with all the discounts its pure value for money.
Samsung nailed it with S23 series this year. Kudos !!

 Compact and sensible smartphone
Reviewed in India on 9 May 2023
Colour: GreenSize: 256GBPattern Name: PhoneVerified Purchase
The Samsung Galaxy S23 is an excellent choice for anyone who's looking for a one-handed and compact smartphone. The ease of using with one hand and the screen area available for use is just about right.
I have listed some points from my usage after 2 months of use - it involves everything except gaming.

What's good about the device?
1. Communications - Network reception is really good. It is very power efficient in 4G mode with SOT more than 8 hours.
Wifi, NFC, casting, Samsung DeX- all of these work reliably well.
5G Communication is also excellent but the SOT with active 5G use drops to around 6 hours.

2. Display - it is good, but it would have been even better if the panel would have been the same from S23 Ultra.

3. Battery life - excellent with normal usage. With calls, 4G and WiFi, and lots of streaming, it easily lasts a day. SOT of 9-10 hours can be obtained quite easily when connected to WiFi. On 5G network, obviously it'll drop off a bit.

4. Performance - Excellent so far. No issues whatsoever.

5. Samsung Pay - excellent features, easy to use, and I don't need to carry my wallet anymore.

6. Camera - takes excellent pictures. Even the night mode works very well.

What's not so good?
1. Charger is missing in the box. OEMs who actually care about sustainability should not copy Apple (or others) and it's ridiculous decisions.

2. Display - sometimes the display seems unresponsive in various apps. Although it is easily fixed by switching between apps or worst case, restarting the app. Not sure if it is hardware related or app related. Not all apps have this issue.
When it happens, it's quite annoying.

However, at the end of the day, I'm happy to have a compact and reliable phone with good network reception and excellent battery life!

 True flagship performance and excellent overall with a (hopefully) temporary glitch.
Reviewed in India on 8 March 2023

The battery backup is very poor at present. Tried tweaking multiple things including changing the performance profile to ""Light"" instead of ""Standard"". That seems to help a bit. But, it's nowhere near the 7-8 hours of screen on time reported in most Youtube reviews and user experience.

My old device was a Xiaomi Redmi K20 Pro, which I exchanged for this. It had more than 100 apps installed and even with that the battery was pretty good. In this phone I have installed only a very few apps until now, so very surprised by the battery life.

Many online forums including Samsung Members app have multiple reports of the same. Seems like its after the Feb 2023 update, hope it'll be fixed in their next update.(fingers crossed)

Other than that it has been a very satisfying and really good experience with butter smooth animations and quick app loading, awesome screen and multimedia content from apps like Netflix is a treat to watch on it. And the ""Expert raw"" app is a beast at grabbing unprecedented level of detailing. Even if I use jpg output from it, it's still far ahead than the regular Camera app in it. However, the default camera app is also pretty solid. The camera images and videos in low light is pretty good.

Another thing I liked is that most of the Samsung apps(that comes by default) which is not needed can be uninstalled.

Note: One thing I learnt the hard way: If you're applying a screen guard/tempered glass afterwards, do register your fingerprint again for best detection.

I looking for a slim low weight good configuration laptop for a while now for work, but then one of my friend suggest me the Lenovo Ideapad Slim 5, at first I was hesitant but when I saw the reviews on YouTube for it I was instantly hooked to it. I really like the way the laptop is designed slim and compact. And it’s performance is perfect for my day to day use. Moreover the screen is so good to watch my favourite shows and YouTube videos.

The slim and compact design of the laptop helps me carry it around almost anywhere with hassle. I’ve also used it for light gaming!!!! SUPER HAPPY to have the Idea pad Slim 5 and excited to be part of the Lenovo family.

1. You don't get one year warranty with the laptop as it is mentioned with the item. But Amazon from its end nominally give you a warranty for one year which won't be reflected in Lenovo Vantage. In order to get your justiciable warranty, you need to struggle a lot with Lenovo. They will ask you 1000 and 100 proofs. If you are not concerned about warranty then you can buy this laptop.
2. This laptop doesn't support Alexa. I tried but I failed. Finally I found that this laptop is not compatible with Alexa.
3. There are many 2024 year manufactured laptops are there. Buy a good one. If you still want this 2023 August manufacture model, then go ahead and buy. It can be a good museum piece in your home.
4. Finally it is your choice to buy headache and tension or a good advanced model of some other company.

JBL Over-Ear Headphones

I recently purchased a pair of JBL over-ear headphones, and I couldn’t be more pleased with my decision. These headphones deliver exceptional sound quality, with deep bass and crisp highs that truly enhance my listening experience, whether I’m enjoying music, podcasts, or movies.

The comfort level is impressive, too. The ear cushions are soft and plush, making them perfect for long listening sessions without causing any discomfort. The adjustable headband ensures a secure fit, which is great for both casual use and more active settings.

Battery life is another standout feature; I easily get several hours of use on a single charge, and the quick charging option is a lifesaver when I’m in a hurry. The wireless connectivity is seamless, with no noticeable lag or dropouts during use.

Additionally, the build quality feels sturdy yet lightweight, making them portable for travel. The included carrying case is a nice touch for protection on the go.

Overall, the JBL over-ear headphones are an excellent choice for anyone looking for high-quality sound and comfort. Highly recommended!

 For a casual usage its the best option
Reviewed in India on 1 January 2024
Colour: BlueVerified Purchase
i have been using this ANC headphone for 3 months. there are many things i would like to share.

Lets break down the few factors

built quality - solid shape for both ears (normal ear size) portable and it folds so u can save space. and it wont fall from the shoulders or while putting in ears and do workouts, it stays in your head perfectly. not water resistant or proof however it is sweat proof and dust proof

Comfort- solid design for a normal ear size and cushions are soft but more than 4-5 hours without taking off use may leads to getting warm. it is basically weightless doesn't hurt head or ear its a nice design actually

ANC- its will not suppress complete surrounding sounds but ye does the job this price range, above 80% volume will turn off the anc to deliver high volume sound

sound quality- never disappoints, its JBL. when u connect using bluetooth .headphone sets around 80% of volume people do complaint about low volume in headphone. u can increase in headphone using physical buttons, however the anc will automatically turn off. the bass is great

App support- doesn't give you JBL app support but in lower models such as JBL Live 670N, JBL 500 BT and higher model such as 770NC , JBL Tune 670NC JBL Tune 770NC only has them

Connections- dual connection is supported u can connect in your lap and mobile at the same time and listen from a device one at a time. and fast pairing in smartphones is so good and u can locate device on find my device too its a good feature

charging- fast charging is supported so for 5 minutes u will get playback time about 2 hours and total charging time takes about half an hour. while charging it heats and cool down
While charging u cant use Bluetooth and the design of the headset also not meant for that
u can use aux after the headset is dead

mic- good for calls and small use it isnt that good especially in windy places (example under the fan in a room) not good for professional use

CONCLUSION
its good for all rounder headphone in this price range. Don't listen what others says even though there are some limitations but its prefect in many aspect. perfect for photographic materiel too. after a full charge i use it for 4 days roughly. if u have budget go for it

 Sound quality is good on wired mode but really bad on wireless mode.
Reviewed in India on 4 August 2024
Colour: BlueVerified Purchase
Just after unboxing, I tested the headphone. On wireless mode, I didn't find the sound quality to be as great as I expected it to be. The noice cancellation was also not exceptional. The main problem was that when I plugged in the audio cable, I found out that the right earcup of the headphone was not working at all. It was because of loose-connection (inside headphones) somewhere I guess. I decided to give it some time before I tested it once again. This time, the wireless mode sound quality dropped significantly (On sharp beats, it started producing cracking sounds). This time on wired mode, both the earcups worked fine and the sound quality was really good. After 2-3 days of usage, cracking sound is still there on wireless mode. Overall I am not satisfied with these headphones. I would recommend not investing such an amount in JBL headphones but rather to go for budget earphones. I don't think JBL puts their best efforts in this price range. If you really want high quality, go for a high-price flagship model.

 Well budgeted ANC headphones with lots of good features
Reviewed in India on 22 October 2023
Colour: BlackVerified Purchase
Pros: good sturdy build and good connectivity and battery life, and aesthetically looks good on you. Active Noise Cancelling is great too.

Cons (likely):

* Charging port doesn't allow for using while charging. I had this in my last headphones (non-brand, cheaper!) and it's so convenient that you miss it and curse whoever is lacking behind in this basic feature. But the good battery backup leaves you plenty time to recharge.

* Too tight. Again, a basic feature IMO to make it feather light which again, a lot of cheaper non-brand headphones are offering, such a shame to see it lacking too. Ears will get hot even in winter/AC. But great if you're a runner, they won't come off.

* Multipoint connection is better than others as it allows you to fully switch between two devices rather divide the audio between calling and music mode. BUT again, the only downside (that maybe only I'm seeing on my Windows PC) that when I switch away from it to my phone, my pc gets entirely disconnected (unlike Android that puts the connection on standby) and I have to re-connect from windows after switching back to it.

* Very little bass. And I feel like ANC might me filtering some of it out, especially at large volume, as the most bass I get at is weirdly at ~80% volume.

Verdict: Well budgeted ANC headphones with lots of good features.

This is probably the best 6.1 inch phone your money can buy and most premium phone in android. I am sure it will beat apple too in value for money.
Got this phone for 50,800 after all the discount and exchanging my Oneplus 7T.

* Build quality is just strong with aluminum frame and gorilla glass victus on both sides.
* Display is full HD and is very pleasing to use. This is the best brightness I have experienced with 1750 nits. 120hz makes the user experience so fluid.
* Storage of 256GB with UFS 4.0 and 8GB RAM makes the phone usage buttery smooth.
* Cameras are top notch and software does a great job is delivering brilliant pictures.
* BATTERY !! Yay this is the best part of this phone and what it can deliver with combination of QCOM Snadragon 8 gen 2 and 3900mah battery. The battery can most likely last 2 days for most common use cases.
* Software experience has been improved with one UI and feels great. The updates are provided for 5 years which is longest in android world.

Overall definitely recommend this phone as its the best compact android phone in 2023 your money can buy especially with all the discounts its pure value for money.
Samsung nailed it with S23 series this year. Kudos !!

 Compact and sensible smartphone
Reviewed in India on 9 May 2023
Colour: GreenSize: 256GBPattern Name: PhoneVerified Purchase
The Samsung Galaxy S23 is an excellent choice for anyone who's looking for a one-handed and compact smartphone. The ease of using with one hand and the screen area available for use is just about right.
I have listed some points from my usage after 2 months of use - it involves everything except gaming.

What's good about the device?
1. Communications - Network reception is really good. It is very power efficient in 4G mode with SOT more than 8 hours.
Wifi, NFC, casting, Samsung DeX- all of these work reliably well.
5G Communication is also excellent but the SOT with active 5G use drops to around 6 hours.

2. Display - it is good, but it would have been even better if the panel would have been the same from S23 Ultra.

3. Battery life - excellent with normal usage. With calls, 4G and WiFi, and lots of streaming, it easily lasts a day. SOT of 9-10 hours can be obtained quite easily when connected to WiFi. On 5G network, obviously it'll drop off a bit.

4. Performance - Excellent so far. No issues whatsoever.

5. Samsung Pay - excellent features, easy to use, and I don't need to carry my wallet anymore.

6. Camera - takes excellent pictures. Even the night mode works very well.

What's not so good?
1. Charger is missing in the box. OEMs who actually care about sustainability should not copy Apple (or others) and it's ridiculous decisions.

2. Display - sometimes the display seems unresponsive in various apps. Although it is easily fixed by switching between apps or worst case, restarting the app. Not sure if it is hardware related or app related. Not all apps have this issue.
When it happens, it's quite annoying.

However, at the end of the day, I'm happy to have a compact and reliable phone with good network reception and excellent battery life!

 True flagship performance and excellent overall with a (hopefully) temporary glitch.
Reviewed in India on 8 March 2023

The battery backup is very poor at present. Tried tweaking multiple things including changing the performance profile to ""Light"" instead of ""Standard"". That seems to help a bit. But, it's nowhere near the 7-8 hours of screen on time reported in most Youtube reviews and user experience.

My old device was a Xiaomi Redmi K20 Pro, which I exchanged for this. It had more than 100 apps installed and even with that the battery was pretty good. In this phone I have installed only a very few apps until now, so very surprised by the battery life.

Many online forums including Samsung Members app have multiple reports of the same. Seems like its after the Feb 2023 update, hope it'll be fixed in their next update.(fingers crossed)

Other than that it has been a very satisfying and really good experience with butter smooth animations and quick app loading, awesome screen and multimedia content from apps like Netflix is a treat to watch on it. And the ""Expert raw"" app is a beast at grabbing unprecedented level of detailing. Even if I use jpg output from it, it's still far ahead than the regular Camera app in it. However, the default camera app is also pretty solid. The camera images and videos in low light is pretty good.

Another thing I liked is that most of the Samsung apps(that comes by default) which is not needed can be uninstalled.

Note: One thing I learnt the hard way: If you're applying a screen guard/tempered glass afterwards, do register your fingerprint again for best detection.

In order to get your justiciable warranty, you need to struggle a lot with Lenovo. They will ask you 1000 and 100 proofs. If you are not concerned about warranty then you can buy this laptop.
2. This laptop doesn't support Alexa. I tried but I failed. Finally I found that this laptop is not compatible with Alexa.
3. There are many 2024 year manufactured laptops are there. Buy a good one. If you still want this 2023 August manufacture model, then go ahead and buy. It can be a good museum piece in your home.
4. Finally it is your choice to buy headache and tension or a good advanced model of some other company.

I got this laptop for everyday use and light office applications like PowerPoint and Excel. It’s super lightweight and I can carry it anywhere I need to without hurting my shoulders.

Pros:
Lightweight
Great Screen
No lag when using most applications

Cons:
Can’t really play any games on it. But have a gaming system for those needs.

 Fantastic Phone - Best Compact Phone Period.
Reviewed in India on 1 March 2023
Colour: GreenSize: 256GBPattern Name: PhoneVerified Purchase
This is probably the best 6.1 inch phone your money can buy and most premium phone in android. I am sure it will beat apple too in value for money.
Got this phone for 50,800 after all the discount and exchanging my Oneplus 7T.

* Build quality is just strong with aluminum frame and gorilla glass victus on both sides.
* Display is full HD and is very pleasing to use. This is the best brightness I have experienced with 1750 nits. 120hz makes the user experience so fluid.
* Storage of 256GB with UFS 4.0 and 8GB RAM makes the phone usage buttery smooth.
* Cameras are top notch and software does a great job is delivering brilliant pictures.
* BATTERY !! Yay this is the best part of this phone and what it can deliver with combination of QCOM Snadragon 8 gen 2 and 3900mah battery. The battery can most likely last 2 days for most common use cases.
* Software experience has been improved with one UI and feels great. The updates are provided for 5 years which is longest in android world.

Overall definitely recommend this phone as its the best compact android phone in 2023 your money can buy especially with all the discounts its pure value for money.
Samsung nailed it with S23 series this year. Kudos !!

 Compact and sensible smartphone
Reviewed in India on 9 May 2023
Colour: GreenSize: 256GBPattern Name: PhoneVerified Purchase
The Samsung Galaxy S23 is an excellent choice for anyone who's looking for a one-handed and compact smartphone. The ease of using with one hand and the screen area available for use is just about right.
I have listed some points from my usage after 2 months of use - it involves everything except gaming.

What's good about the device?
1. Communications - Network reception is really good. It is very power efficient in 4G mode with SOT more than 8 hours.
Wifi, NFC, casting, Samsung DeX- all of these work reliably well.
5G Communication is also excellent but the SOT with active 5G use drops to around 6 hours.

2. Display - it is good, but it would have been even better if the panel would have been the same from S23 Ultra.

3. Battery life - excellent with normal usage. With calls, 4G and WiFi, and lots of streaming, it easily lasts a day. SOT of 9-10 hours can be obtained quite easily when connected to WiFi. On 5G network, obviously it'll drop off a bit.

4. Performance - Excellent so far. No issues whatsoever.

5. Samsung Pay - excellent features, easy to use, and I don't need to carry my wallet anymore.

6. Camera - takes excellent pictures. Even the night mode works very well.

What's not so good?
1. Charger is missing in the box. OEMs who actually care about sustainability should not copy Apple (or others) and it's ridiculous decisions.

2. Display - sometimes the display seems unresponsive in various apps. Although it is easily fixed by switching between apps or worst case, restarting the app. Not sure if it is hardware related or app related. Not all apps have this issue.
When it happens, it's quite annoying.

However, at the end of the day, I'm happy to have a compact and reliable phone with good network reception and excellent battery life!

 True flagship performance and excellent overall with a (hopefully) temporary glitch.
Reviewed in India on 8 March 2023
Verified Purchase
The battery backup is very poor at present. Tried tweaking multiple things including changing the performance profile to ""Light"" instead of ""Standard"". That seems to help a bit. But, it's nowhere near the 7-8 hours of screen on time reported in most Youtube reviews and user experience.

My old device was a Xiaomi Redmi K20 Pro, which I exchanged for this. It had more than 100 apps installed and even with that the battery was pretty good. In this phone I have installed only a very few apps until now, so very surprised by the battery life.

Many online forums including Samsung Members app have multiple reports of the same. Seems like its after the Feb 2023 update, hope it'll be fixed in their next update.(fingers crossed)

Other than that it has been a very satisfying and really good experience with butter smooth animations and quick app loading, awesome screen and multimedia content from apps like Netflix is a treat to watch on it. And the ""Expert raw"" app is a beast at grabbing unprecedented level of detailing. Even if I use jpg output from it, it's still far ahead than the regular Camera app in it. However, the default camera app is also pretty solid. The camera images and videos in low light is pretty good.

Another thing I liked is that most of the Samsung apps(that comes by default) which is not needed can be uninstalled.

Note: One thing I learnt the hard way: If you're applying a screen guard/tempered glass afterwards, do register your fingerprint again for best detection.

 Fantastic Phone - Best Compact Phone Period.

This is probably the best 6.1 inch phone your money can buy and most premium phone in android. I am sure it will beat apple too in value for money.
Got this phone for 50,800 after all the discount and exchanging my Oneplus 7T.

* Build quality is just strong with aluminum frame and gorilla glass victus on both sides.
* Display is full HD and is very pleasing to use. This is the best brightness I have experienced with 1750 nits. 120hz makes the user experience so fluid.
* Storage of 256GB with UFS 4.0 and 8GB RAM makes the phone usage buttery smooth.
* Cameras are top notch and software does a great job is delivering brilliant pictures.
* BATTERY !! Yay this is the best part of this phone and what it can deliver with combination of QCOM Snadragon 8 gen 2 and 3900mah battery. The battery can most likely last 2 days for most common use cases.
* Software experience has been improved with one UI and feels great. The updates are provided for 5 years which is longest in android world.

Overall definitely recommend this phone as its the best compact android phone in 2023 your money can buy especially with all the discounts its pure value for money.
Samsung nailed it with S23 series this year. Kudos !!

 Compact and sensible smartphone
Reviewed in India on 9 May 2023
Colour: GreenSize: 256GBPattern Name: PhoneVerified Purchase
The Samsung Galaxy S23 is an excellent choice for anyone who's looking for a one-handed and compact smartphone. The ease of using with one hand and the screen area available for use is just about right.
I have listed some points from my usage after 2 months of use - it involves everything except gaming.

What's good about the device?
1. Communications - Network reception is really good. It is very power efficient in 4G mode with SOT more than 8 hours.
Wifi, NFC, casting, Samsung DeX- all of these work reliably well.
5G Communication is also excellent but the SOT with active 5G use drops to around 6 hours.

2. Display - it is good, but it would have been even better if the panel would have been the same from S23 Ultra.

3. Battery life - excellent with normal usage. With calls, 4G and WiFi, and lots of streaming, it easily lasts a day. SOT of 9-10 hours can be obtained quite easily when connected to WiFi. On 5G network, obviously it'll drop off a bit.

4. Performance - Excellent so far. No issues whatsoever.

5. Samsung Pay - excellent features, easy to use, and I don't need to carry my wallet anymore.

6. Camera - takes excellent pictures. Even the night mode works very well.

What's not so good?
1. Charger is missing in the box. OEMs who actually care about sustainability should not copy Apple (or others) and it's ridiculous decisions.

2. Display - sometimes the display seems unresponsive in various apps. Although it is easily fixed by switching between apps or worst case, restarting the app. Not sure if it is hardware related or app related. Not all apps have this issue.
When it happens, it's quite annoying.

However, at the end of the day, I'm happy to have a compact and reliable phone with good network reception and excellent battery life!

 True flagship performance and excellent overall with a (hopefully) temporary glitch.
Reviewed in India on 8 March 2023

The battery backup is very poor at present. Tried tweaking multiple things including changing the performance profile to ""Light"" instead of ""Standard"". That seems to help a bit. But, it's nowhere near the 7-8 hours of screen on time reported in most Youtube reviews and user experience.

My old device was a Xiaomi Redmi K20 Pro, which I exchanged for this. It had more than 100 apps installed and even with that the battery was pretty good. In this phone I have installed only a very few apps until now, so very surprised by the battery life.

Many online forums including Samsung Members app have multiple reports of the same. Seems like its after the Feb 2023 update, hope it'll be fixed in their next update.(fingers crossed)

Other than that it has been a very satisfying and really good experience with butter smooth animations and quick app loading, awesome screen and multimedia content from apps like Netflix is a treat to watch on it. And the ""Expert raw"" app is a beast at grabbing unprecedented level of detailing. Even if I use jpg output from it, it's still far ahead than the regular Camera app in it. However, the default camera app is also pretty solid. The camera images and videos in low light is pretty good.

Another thing I liked is that most of the Samsung apps(that comes by default) which is not needed can be uninstalled.

Note: One thing I learnt the hard way: If you're applying a screen guard/tempered glass afterwards, do register your fingerprint again for best detection.

JBL Over-Ear Headphones

I recently purchased a pair of JBL over-ear headphones, and I couldn’t be more pleased with my decision. These headphones deliver exceptional sound quality, with deep bass and crisp highs that truly enhance my listening experience, whether I’m enjoying music, podcasts, or movies.

The comfort level is impressive, too. The ear cushions are soft and plush, making them perfect for long listening sessions without causing any discomfort. The adjustable headband ensures a secure fit, which is great for both casual use and more active settings.

Battery life is another standout feature; I easily get several hours of use on a single charge, and the quick charging option is a lifesaver when I’m in a hurry. The wireless connectivity is seamless, with no noticeable lag or dropouts during use.

Additionally, the build quality feels sturdy yet lightweight, making them portable for travel. The included carrying case is a nice touch for protection on the go.

Overall, the JBL over-ear headphones are an excellent choice for anyone looking for high-quality sound and comfort. Highly recommended!

 For a casual usage its the best option
Reviewed in India on 1 January 2024
Colour: BlueVerified Purchase
i have been using this ANC headphone for 3 months. there are many things i would like to share.

Lets break down the few factors

built quality - solid shape for both ears (normal ear size) portable and it folds so u can save space. and it wont fall from the shoulders or while putting in ears and do workouts, it stays in your head perfectly. not water resistant or proof however it is sweat proof and dust proof

Comfort- solid design for a normal ear size and cushions are soft but more than 4-5 hours without taking off use may leads to getting warm. it is basically weightless doesn't hurt head or ear its a nice design actually

ANC- its will not suppress complete surrounding sounds but ye does the job this price range, above 80% volume will turn off the anc to deliver high volume sound

sound quality- never disappoints, its JBL. when u connect using bluetooth .headphone sets around 80% of volume people do complaint about low volume in headphone. u can increase in headphone using physical buttons, however the anc will automatically turn off. the bass is great

App support- doesn't give you JBL app support but in lower models such as JBL Live 670N, JBL 500 BT and higher model such as 770NC , JBL Tune 670NC JBL Tune 770NC only has them

Connections- dual connection is supported u can connect in your lap and mobile at the same time and listen from a device one at a time. and fast pairing in smartphones is so good and u can locate device on find my device too its a good feature

charging- fast charging is supported so for 5 minutes u will get playback time about 2 hours and total charging time takes about half an hour. while charging it heats and cool down
While charging u cant use Bluetooth and the design of the headset also not meant for that
u can use aux after the headset is dead

mic- good for calls and small use it isnt that good especially in windy places (example under the fan in a room) not good for professional use

CONCLUSION
its good for all rounder headphone in this price range. Don't listen what others says even though there are some limitations but its prefect in many aspect. perfect for photographic materiel too. after a full charge i use it for 4 days roughly. if u have budget go for it

 Sound quality is good on wired mode but really bad on wireless mode.
Reviewed in India on 4 August 2024
Colour: BlueVerified Purchase
Just after unboxing, I tested the headphone. On wireless mode, I didn't find the sound quality to be as great as I expected it to be. The noice cancellation was also not exceptional. The main problem was that when I plugged in the audio cable, I found out that the right earcup of the headphone was not working at all. It was because of loose-connection (inside headphones) somewhere I guess. I decided to give it some time before I tested it once again. This time, the wireless mode sound quality dropped significantly (On sharp beats, it started producing cracking sounds). This time on wired mode, both the earcups worked fine and the sound quality was really good. After 2-3 days of usage, cracking sound is still there on wireless mode. Overall I am not satisfied with these headphones. I would recommend not investing such an amount in JBL headphones but rather to go for budget earphones. I don't think JBL puts their best efforts in this price range. If you really want high quality, go for a high-price flagship model.

 Well budgeted ANC headphones with lots of good features
Reviewed in India on 22 October 2023
Colour: BlackVerified Purchase
Pros: good sturdy build and good connectivity and battery life, and aesthetically looks good on you. Active Noise Cancelling is great too.

Cons (likely):

* Charging port doesn't allow for using while charging. I had this in my last headphones (non-brand, cheaper!) and it's so convenient that you miss it and curse whoever is lacking behind in this basic feature. But the good battery backup leaves you plenty time to recharge.

* Too tight. Again, a basic feature IMO to make it feather light which again, a lot of cheaper non-brand headphones are offering, such a shame to see it lacking too. Ears will get hot even in winter/AC. But great if you're a runner, they won't come off.

* Multipoint connection is better than others as it allows you to fully switch between two devices rather divide the audio between calling and music mode. BUT again, the only downside (that maybe only I'm seeing on my Windows PC) that when I switch away from it to my phone, my pc gets entirely disconnected (unlike Android that puts the connection on standby) and I have to re-connect from windows after switching back to it.

* Very little bass. And I feel like ANC might me filtering some of it out, especially at large volume, as the most bass I get at is weirdly at ~80% volume.

Verdict: Well budgeted ANC headphones with lots of good features.

Exchange facility
Amazon exchange facility is much better than Flipkart. For the same old fridge (which was 17 yrs old but in good working condition), Flipkart refused to accept saying there are a few (minor) rust marks at bottom of door whereas Amazon accepted without any fuss.

Price
After researching on various 335ltr models, decided on this one due to features and price. Bought on 24-Oct-20 for a effective price of INR 27,500 after exchange, discounts and card cashback.

Delivery & Installation
The new fridge was delivered in good condition without any scratch or damage. Since I was without a fridge when the new one was delivered at 12pm (old taken away in exchange), the LG technician accepted my request to come the same day (at 4pm) and install the new one. I am thankful for this excellent gesture on his part.

Pros
The fridge area is spacious and feels bigger than the earlier LG 390 ltrs model which I was using. This is becos of the more shelves in this model. The pull out tray and the convertible box (above the veg bin) are very useful. The cooling at mid settings is good. The external look in very elegant. The build quality is very good and the fridge has sturdy look overall.

Cons
The vegetable / fruit storage bin at the bottom seems constricted in size and does not move freely. The inside area of freezer compartment also seems smaller as compared to the view from outside. The ice trays / storage occupy much space. No light in the freezer - not sure why LG does not install (even my 17 yr old did not have) inspite of its usefulness and every review mentioning this as a drawback. The user manual is very basic and does not explain the high / low feature in the convertible box / veg bin.

Overall
Though the cons look more, they are not so significant as compared to the good features. I am satisfied with this model and will recommend it.

I got damaged product and I placed for return, I’m not blaming LG company, from the LG, everything is fine, I’m talking about the delhivery company, it took nearly half a month to pickup a product, the wooooooorst agent and the wooooorst company, to delivery a refrigerator, only one person is it enough? But Amazon apps says two people will come to deliver. Before signing any contract, Amazon have to do background check up, Now a days every company doing background check up, for a small small postions. I think this company don’t even have an application where the agent can send a pic of the Customer building, so that it confirms he or she visited the customer location, they gave another option like contact was made but unable to reach customer, wooooow amazing, if he made a contact to the customer, this company app should witness the customer number, in this way should confirm, because of I’m staying in 2nd floor, they don’t want to deliver on the floor, then why Amazon accepting the order, if they are charging for the 2nd, 1st floor separately, we are ok to pay but this a wooooorst company where only one person delivering the refrigerator. What if the senior citizens staying on 2nd floor.
After reading this review people will think that , it’s not a company mistake, it’s mistake of agents.
Woooooooow
Keeping this I have asked few questions with agents he said, company only saying that not to deliver the product on the 2nd floor separately, deliver on ground floor, it doesn’t matter where they are staying.
From this I understood, company thinking about money not about growing in the future.
So, Amazon has open their eyes, think once again to do business with this wooooorst company.

Thank you.

Can’t really play any games on it. But have a gaming system for those needs.

I looking for a slim low weight good configuration laptop for a while now for work, but then one of my friend suggest me the Lenovo Ideapad Slim 5, at first I was hesitant but when I saw the reviews on YouTube for it I was instantly hooked to it. I really like the way the laptop is designed slim and compact. And it’s performance is perfect for my day to day use. Moreover the screen is so good to watch my favourite shows and YouTube videos.

The slim and compact design of the laptop helps me carry it around almost anywhere with hassle. I’ve also used it for light gaming!!!! SUPER HAPPY to have the Idea pad Slim 5 and excited to be part of the Lenovo family.

 Points to know before you purchase Lenovo laptop on Amazon stores:
Reviewed in India on 29 July 2024
Colour: CloudVerified Purchase
1. You don't get one year warranty with the laptop as it is mentioned with the item. But Amazon from its end nominally give you a warranty for one year which won't be reflected in Lenovo Vantage. In order to get your justiciable warranty, you need to struggle a lot with Lenovo. They will ask you 1000 and 100 proofs. If you are not concerned about warranty then you can buy this laptop.
2. This laptop doesn't support Alexa. I tried but I failed. Finally I found that this laptop is not compatible with Alexa.
3. There are many 2024 year manufactured laptops are there. Buy a good one. If you still want this 2023 August manufacture model, then go ahead and buy. It can be a good museum piece in your home.
4. Finally it is your choice to buy headache and tension or a good advanced model of some other company.

 Fantastic Phone - Best Compact Phone Period.

This is probably the best 6.1 inch phone your money can buy and most premium phone in android. I am sure it will beat apple too in value for money.
Got this phone for 50,800 after all the discount and exchanging my Oneplus 7T.

* Build quality is just strong with aluminum frame and gorilla glass victus on both sides.
* Display is full HD and is very pleasing to use. This is the best brightness I have experienced with 1750 nits. 120hz makes the user experience so fluid.
* Storage of 256GB with UFS 4.0 and 8GB RAM makes the phone usage buttery smooth.
* Cameras are top notch and software does a great job is delivering brilliant pictures.
* BATTERY !! Yay this is the best part of this phone and what it can deliver with combination of QCOM Snadragon 8 gen 2 and 3900mah battery. The battery can most likely last 2 days for most common use cases.
* Software experience has been improved with one UI and feels great. The updates are provided for 5 years which is longest in android world.

Overall definitely recommend this phone as its the best compact android phone in 2023 your money can buy especially with all the discounts its pure value for money.
Samsung nailed it with S23 series this year. Kudos !!

 Compact and sensible smartphone
Reviewed in India on 9 May 2023
Colour: GreenSize: 256GBPattern Name: PhoneVerified Purchase
The Samsung Galaxy S23 is an excellent choice for anyone who's looking for a one-handed and compact smartphone. The ease of using with one hand and the screen area available for use is just about right.
I have listed some points from my usage after 2 months of use - it involves everything except gaming.

What's good about the device?
1. Communications - Network reception is really good. It is very power efficient in 4G mode with SOT more than 8 hours.
Wifi, NFC, casting, Samsung DeX- all of these work reliably well.
5G Communication is also excellent but the SOT with active 5G use drops to around 6 hours.

2. Display - it is good, but it would have been even better if the panel would have been the same from S23 Ultra.

3. Battery life - excellent with normal usage. With calls, 4G and WiFi, and lots of streaming, it easily lasts a day. SOT of 9-10 hours can be obtained quite easily when connected to WiFi. On 5G network, obviously it'll drop off a bit.

4. Performance - Excellent so far. No issues whatsoever.

5. Samsung Pay - excellent features, easy to use, and I don't need to carry my wallet anymore.

6. Camera - takes excellent pictures. Even the night mode works very well.

What's not so good?
1. Charger is missing in the box. OEMs who actually care about sustainability should not copy Apple (or others) and it's ridiculous decisions.

2. Display - sometimes the display seems unresponsive in various apps. Although it is easily fixed by switching between apps or worst case, restarting the app. Not sure if it is hardware related or app related. Not all apps have this issue.
When it happens, it's quite annoying.

However, at the end of the day, I'm happy to have a compact and reliable phone with good network reception and excellent battery life!

 True flagship performance and excellent overall with a (hopefully) temporary glitch.
Reviewed in India on 8 March 2023

The battery backup is very poor at present. Tried tweaking multiple things including changing the performance profile to ""Light"" instead of ""Standard"". That seems to help a bit. But, it's nowhere near the 7-8 hours of screen on time reported in most Youtube reviews and user experience.

My old device was a Xiaomi Redmi K20 Pro, which I exchanged for this. It had more than 100 apps installed and even with that the battery was pretty good. In this phone I have installed only a very few apps until now, so very surprised by the battery life.

Many online forums including Samsung Members app have multiple reports of the same. Seems like its after the Feb 2023 update, hope it'll be fixed in their next update.(fingers crossed)

Other than that it has been a very satisfying and really good experience with butter smooth animations and quick app loading, awesome screen and multimedia content from apps like Netflix is a treat to watch on it. And the ""Expert raw"" app is a beast at grabbing unprecedented level of detailing. Even if I use jpg output from it, it's still far ahead than the regular Camera app in it. However, the default camera app is also pretty solid. The camera images and videos in low light is pretty good.

Another thing I liked is that most of the Samsung apps(that comes by default) which is not needed can be uninstalled.

Note: One thing I learnt the hard way: If you're applying a screen guard/tempered glass afterwards, do register your fingerprint again for best detection.

1. You don't get one year warranty with the laptop as it is mentioned with the item. But Amazon from its end nominally give you a warranty for one year which won't be reflected in Lenovo Vantage. In order to get your justiciable warranty, you need to struggle a lot with Lenovo. They will ask you 1000 and 100 proofs. If you are not concerned about warranty then you can buy this laptop.
2. This laptop doesn't support Alexa. I tried but I failed. Finally I found that this laptop is not compatible with Alexa.
3. There are many 2024 year manufactured laptops are there. Buy a good one. If you still want this 2023 August manufacture model, then go ahead and buy. It can be a good museum piece in your home.
4. Finally it is your choice to buy headache and tension or a good advanced model of some other company.

I got this laptop for everyday use and light office applications like PowerPoint and Excel. It’s super lightweight and I can carry it anywhere I need to without hurting my shoulders.

Pros:
Lightweight
Great Screen
No lag when using most applications

Cons:
Can’t really play any games on it. But have a gaming system for those needs.

I looking for a slim low weight good configuration laptop for a while now for work, but then one of my friend suggest me the Lenovo Ideapad Slim 5, at first I was hesitant but when I saw the reviews on YouTube for it I was instantly hooked to it. I really like the way the laptop is designed slim and compact. And it’s performance is perfect for my day to day use. Moreover the screen is so good to watch my favourite shows and YouTube videos.

The slim and compact design of the laptop helps me carry it around almost anywhere with hassle. I’ve also used it for light gaming!!!! SUPER HAPPY to have the Idea pad Slim 5 and excited to be part of the Lenovo family.

 Fantastic Phone - Best Compact Phone Period.

Colour: GreenSize: 256GBPattern Name: PhoneVerified Purchase
This is probably the best 6.1 inch phone your money can buy and most premium phone in android. I am sure it will beat apple too in value for money.
Got this phone for 50,800 after all the discount and exchanging my Oneplus 7T.

* Build quality is just strong with aluminum frame and gorilla glass victus on both sides.
* Display is full HD and is very pleasing to use. This is the best brightness I have experienced with 1750 nits. 120hz makes the user experience so fluid.
* Storage of 256GB with UFS 4.0 and 8GB RAM makes the phone usage buttery smooth.
* Cameras are top notch and software does a great job is delivering brilliant pictures.
* BATTERY !! Yay this is the best part of this phone and what it can deliver with combination of QCOM Snadragon 8 gen 2 and 3900mah battery. The battery can most likely last 2 days for most common use cases.
* Software experience has been improved with one UI and feels great. The updates are provided for 5 years which is longest in android world.

Overall definitely recommend this phone as its the best compact android phone in 2023 your money can buy especially with all the discounts its pure value for money.
Samsung nailed it with S23 series this year. Kudos !!

 Compact and sensible smartphone
Reviewed in India on 9 May 2023
Colour: GreenSize: 256GBPattern Name: PhoneVerified Purchase
The Samsung Galaxy S23 is an excellent choice for anyone who's looking for a one-handed and compact smartphone. The ease of using with one hand and the screen area available for use is just about right.
I have listed some points from my usage after 2 months of use - it involves everything except gaming.

What's good about the device?
1. Communications - Network reception is really good. It is very power efficient in 4G mode with SOT more than 8 hours.
Wifi, NFC, casting, Samsung DeX- all of these work reliably well.
5G Communication is also excellent but the SOT with active 5G use drops to around 6 hours.

2. Display - it is good, but it would have been even better if the panel would have been the same from S23 Ultra.

3. Battery life - excellent with normal usage. With calls, 4G and WiFi, and lots of streaming, it easily lasts a day. SOT of 9-10 hours can be obtained quite easily when connected to WiFi. On 5G network, obviously it'll drop off a bit.

4. Performance - Excellent so far. No issues whatsoever.

5. Samsung Pay - excellent features, easy to use, and I don't need to carry my wallet anymore.

6. Camera - takes excellent pictures. Even the night mode works very well.

What's not so good?
1. Charger is missing in the box. OEMs who actually care about sustainability should not copy Apple (or others) and it's ridiculous decisions.

2. Display - sometimes the display seems unresponsive in various apps. Although it is easily fixed by switching between apps or worst case, restarting the app. Not sure if it is hardware related or app related. Not all apps have this issue.
When it happens, it's quite annoying.

However, at the end of the day, I'm happy to have a compact and reliable phone with good network reception and excellent battery life!

 True flagship performance and excellent overall with a (hopefully) temporary glitch.
Reviewed in India on 8 March 2023
Verified Purchase
The battery backup is very poor at present. Tried tweaking multiple things including changing the performance profile to ""Light"" instead of ""Standard"". That seems to help a bit. But, it's nowhere near the 7-8 hours of screen on time reported in most Youtube reviews and user experience.

My old device was a Xiaomi Redmi K20 Pro, which I exchanged for this. It had more than 100 apps installed and even with that the battery was pretty good. In this phone I have installed only a very few apps until now, so very surprised by the battery life.

Many online forums including Samsung Members app have multiple reports of the same. Seems like its after the Feb 2023 update, hope it'll be fixed in their next update.(fingers crossed)

Other than that it has been a very satisfying and really good experience with butter smooth animations and quick app loading, awesome screen and multimedia content from apps like Netflix is a treat to watch on it. And the ""Expert raw"" app is a beast at grabbing unprecedented level of detailing. Even if I use jpg output from it, it's still far ahead than the regular Camera app in it. However, the default camera app is also pretty solid. The camera images and videos in low light is pretty good.

Another thing I liked is that most of the Samsung apps(that comes by default) which is not needed can be uninstalled.

Note: One thing I learnt the hard way: If you're applying a screen guard/tempered glass afterwards, do register your fingerprint again for best detection.

JBL Over-Ear Headphones

I recently purchased a pair of JBL over-ear headphones, and I couldn’t be more pleased with my decision. These headphones deliver exceptional sound quality, with deep bass and crisp highs that truly enhance my listening experience, whether I’m enjoying music, podcasts, or movies.

The comfort level is impressive, too. The ear cushions are soft and plush, making them perfect for long listening sessions without causing any discomfort. The adjustable headband ensures a secure fit, which is great for both casual use and more active settings.

Battery life is another standout feature; I easily get several hours of use on a single charge, and the quick charging option is a lifesaver when I’m in a hurry. The wireless connectivity is seamless, with no noticeable lag or dropouts during use.

Additionally, the build quality feels sturdy yet lightweight, making them portable for travel. The included carrying case is a nice touch for protection on the go.

Overall, the JBL over-ear headphones are an excellent choice for anyone looking for high-quality sound and comfort. Highly recommended!

 For a casual usage its the best option
Reviewed in India on 1 January 2024
Colour: BlueVerified Purchase
i have been using this ANC headphone for 3 months. there are many things i would like to share.

Lets break down the few factors

built quality - solid shape for both ears (normal ear size) portable and it folds so u can save space. and it wont fall from the shoulders or while putting in ears and do workouts, it stays in your head perfectly. not water resistant or proof however it is sweat proof and dust proof

Comfort- solid design for a normal ear size and cushions are soft but more than 4-5 hours without taking off use may leads to getting warm. it is basically weightless doesn't hurt head or ear its a nice design actually

ANC- its will not suppress complete surrounding sounds but ye does the job this price range, above 80% volume will turn off the anc to deliver high volume sound

sound quality- never disappoints, its JBL. when u connect using bluetooth .headphone sets around 80% of volume people do complaint about low volume in headphone. u can increase in headphone using physical buttons, however the anc will automatically turn off. the bass is great

App support- doesn't give you JBL app support but in lower models such as JBL Live 670N, JBL 500 BT and higher model such as 770NC , JBL Tune 670NC JBL Tune 770NC only has them

Connections- dual connection is supported u can connect in your lap and mobile at the same time and listen from a device one at a time. and fast pairing in smartphones is so good and u can locate device on find my device too its a good feature

charging- fast charging is supported so for 5 minutes u will get playback time about 2 hours and total charging time takes about half an hour. while charging it heats and cool down
While charging u cant use Bluetooth and the design of the headset also not meant for that
u can use aux after the headset is dead

mic- good for calls and small use it isnt that good especially in windy places (example under the fan in a room) not good for professional use

CONCLUSION
its good for all rounder headphone in this price range. Don't listen what others says even though there are some limitations but its prefect in many aspect. perfect for photographic materiel too. after a full charge i use it for 4 days roughly. if u have budget go for it

 Sound quality is good on wired mode but really bad on wireless mode.
Reviewed in India on 4 August 2024
Colour: BlueVerified Purchase
Just after unboxing, I tested the headphone. On wireless mode, I didn't find the sound quality to be as great as I expected it to be. The noice cancellation was also not exceptional. The main problem was that when I plugged in the audio cable, I found out that the right earcup of the headphone was not working at all. It was because of loose-connection (inside headphones) somewhere I guess. I decided to give it some time before I tested it once again. This time, the wireless mode sound quality dropped significantly (On sharp beats, it started producing cracking sounds). This time on wired mode, both the earcups worked fine and the sound quality was really good. After 2-3 days of usage, cracking sound is still there on wireless mode. Overall I am not satisfied with these headphones. I would recommend not investing such an amount in JBL headphones but rather to go for budget earphones. I don't think JBL puts their best efforts in this price range. If you really want high quality, go for a high-price flagship model.

 Well budgeted ANC headphones with lots of good features
Reviewed in India on 22 October 2023
Colour: BlackVerified Purchase
Pros: good sturdy build and good connectivity and battery life, and aesthetically looks good on you. Active Noise Cancelling is great too.

Cons (likely):

* Charging port doesn't allow for using while charging. I had this in my last headphones (non-brand, cheaper!) and it's so convenient that you miss it and curse whoever is lacking behind in this basic feature. But the good battery backup leaves you plenty time to recharge.

* Too tight. Again, a basic feature IMO to make it feather light which again, a lot of cheaper non-brand headphones are offering, such a shame to see it lacking too. Ears will get hot even in winter/AC. But great if you're a runner, they won't come off.

* Multipoint connection is better than others as it allows you to fully switch between two devices rather divide the audio between calling and music mode. BUT again, the only downside (that maybe only I'm seeing on my Windows PC) that when I switch away from it to my phone, my pc gets entirely disconnected (unlike Android that puts the connection on standby) and I have to re-connect from windows after switching back to it.

* Very little bass. And I feel like ANC might me filtering some of it out, especially at large volume, as the most bass I get at is weirdly at ~80% volume.

Verdict: Well budgeted ANC headphones with lots of good features.

1. You don't get one year warranty with the laptop as it is mentioned with the item. But Amazon from its end nominally give you a warranty for one year which won't be reflected in Lenovo Vantage. In order to get your justiciable warranty, you need to struggle a lot with Lenovo. They will ask you 1000 and 100 proofs. If you are not concerned about warranty then you can buy this laptop.
2. This laptop doesn't support Alexa. I tried but I failed. Finally I found that this laptop is not compatible with Alexa.
3. There are many 2024 year manufactured laptops are there. Buy a good one. If you still want this 2023 August manufacture model, then go ahead and buy. It can be a good museum piece in your home.
4. Finally it is your choice to buy headache and tension or a good advanced model of some other company.

This is probably the best 6.1 inch phone your money can buy and most premium phone in android. I am sure it will beat apple too in value for money.
Got this phone for 50,800 after all the discount and exchanging my Oneplus 7T.

* Build quality is just strong with aluminum frame and gorilla glass victus on both sides.
* Display is full HD and is very pleasing to use. This is the best brightness I have experienced with 1750 nits. 120hz makes the user experience so fluid.
* Storage of 256GB with UFS 4.0 and 8GB RAM makes the phone usage buttery smooth.
* Cameras are top notch and software does a great job is delivering brilliant pictures.
* BATTERY !! Yay this is the best part of this phone and what it can deliver with combination of QCOM Snadragon 8 gen 2 and 3900mah battery. The battery can most likely last 2 days for most common use cases.
* Software experience has been improved with one UI and feels great. The updates are provided for 5 years which is longest in android world.

Overall definitely recommend this phone as its the best compact android phone in 2023 your money can buy especially with all the discounts its pure value for money.
Samsung nailed it with S23 series this year. Kudos !!

 Compact and sensible smartphone
Reviewed in India on 9 May 2023
Colour: GreenSize: 256GBPattern Name: PhoneVerified Purchase
The Samsung Galaxy S23 is an excellent choice for anyone who's looking for a one-handed and compact smartphone. The ease of using with one hand and the screen area available for use is just about right.
I have listed some points from my usage after 2 months of use - it involves everything except gaming.

What's good about the device?
1. Communications - Network reception is really good. It is very power efficient in 4G mode with SOT more than 8 hours.
Wifi, NFC, casting, Samsung DeX- all of these work reliably well.
5G Communication is also excellent but the SOT with active 5G use drops to around 6 hours.

2. Display - it is good, but it would have been even better if the panel would have been the same from S23 Ultra.

3. Battery life - excellent with normal usage. With calls, 4G and WiFi, and lots of streaming, it easily lasts a day. SOT of 9-10 hours can be obtained quite easily when connected to WiFi. On 5G network, obviously it'll drop off a bit.

4. Performance - Excellent so far. No issues whatsoever.

5. Samsung Pay - excellent features, easy to use, and I don't need to carry my wallet anymore.

6. Camera - takes excellent pictures. Even the night mode works very well.

What's not so good?
1. Charger is missing in the box. OEMs who actually care about sustainability should not copy Apple (or others) and it's ridiculous decisions.

2. Display - sometimes the display seems unresponsive in various apps. Although it is easily fixed by switching between apps or worst case, restarting the app. Not sure if it is hardware related or app related. Not all apps have this issue.
When it happens, it's quite annoying.

However, at the end of the day, I'm happy to have a compact and reliable phone with good network reception and excellent battery life!

 True flagship performance and excellent overall with a (hopefully) temporary glitch.
Reviewed in India on 8 March 2023

The battery backup is very poor at present. Tried tweaking multiple things including changing the performance profile to ""Light"" instead of ""Standard"". That seems to help a bit. But, it's nowhere near the 7-8 hours of screen on time reported in most Youtube reviews and user experience.

My old device was a Xiaomi Redmi K20 Pro, which I exchanged for this. It had more than 100 apps installed and even with that the battery was pretty good. In this phone I have installed only a very few apps until now, so very surprised by the battery life.

Many online forums including Samsung Members app have multiple reports of the same. Seems like its after the Feb 2023 update, hope it'll be fixed in their next update.(fingers crossed)

Other than that it has been a very satisfying and really good experience with butter smooth animations and quick app loading, awesome screen and multimedia content from apps like Netflix is a treat to watch on it. And the ""Expert raw"" app is a beast at grabbing unprecedented level of detailing. Even if I use jpg output from it, it's still far ahead than the regular Camera app in it. However, the default camera app is also pretty solid. The camera images and videos in low light is pretty good.

Another thing I liked is that most of the Samsung apps(that comes by default) which is not needed can be uninstalled.

Note: One thing I learnt the hard way: If you're applying a screen guard/tempered glass afterwards, do register your fingerprint again for best detection.

Colour: GreenSize: 256GBPattern Name: PhoneVerified Purchase
This is probably the best 6.1 inch phone your money can buy and most premium phone in android. I am sure it will beat apple too in value for money.
Got this phone for 50,800 after all the discount and exchanging my Oneplus 7T.

* Build quality is just strong with aluminum frame and gorilla glass victus on both sides.
* Display is full HD and is very pleasing to use. This is the best brightness I have experienced with 1750 nits. 120hz makes the user experience so fluid.
* Storage of 256GB with UFS 4.0 and 8GB RAM makes the phone usage buttery smooth.
* Cameras are top notch and software does a great job is delivering brilliant pictures.
* BATTERY !! Yay this is the best part of this phone and what it can deliver with combination of QCOM Snadragon 8 gen 2 and 3900mah battery. The battery can most likely last 2 days for most common use cases.
* Software experience has been improved with one UI and feels great. The updates are provided for 5 years which is longest in android world.

Overall definitely recommend this phone as its the best compact android phone in 2023 your money can buy especially with all the discounts its pure value for money.
Samsung nailed it with S23 series this year. Kudos !!

"Samsung Galaxy S23 5G(Phantom Black, 128 GB)","	Milon

 Compact and sensible smartphone
Reviewed in India on 9 May 2023
Colour: GreenSize: 256GBPattern Name: PhoneVerified Purchase
The Samsung Galaxy S23 is an excellent choice for anyone who's looking for a one-handed and compact smartphone. The ease of using with one hand and the screen area available for use is just about right.
I have listed some points from my usage after 2 months of use - it involves everything except gaming.

What's good about the device?
1. Communications - Network reception is really good. It is very power efficient in 4G mode with SOT more than 8 hours.
Wifi, NFC, casting, Samsung DeX- all of these work reliably well.
5G Communication is also excellent but the SOT with active 5G use drops to around 6 hours.

2. Display - it is good, but it would have been even better if the panel would have been the same from S23 Ultra.

3. Battery life - excellent with normal usage. With calls, 4G and WiFi, and lots of streaming, it easily lasts a day. SOT of 9-10 hours can be obtained quite easily when connected to WiFi. On 5G network, obviously it'll drop off a bit.

4. Performance - Excellent so far. No issues whatsoever.

5. Samsung Pay - excellent features, easy to use, and I don't need to carry my wallet anymore.

6. Camera - takes excellent pictures. Even the night mode works very well.

What's not so good?
1. Charger is missing in the box. OEMs who actually care about sustainability should not copy Apple (or others) and it's ridiculous decisions.

2. Display - sometimes the display seems unresponsive in various apps. Although it is easily fixed by switching between apps or worst case, restarting the app. Not sure if it is hardware related or app related. Not all apps have this issue.
When it happens, it's quite annoying.

However, at the end of the day, I'm happy to have a compact and reliable phone with good network reception and excellent battery life!

 True flagship performance and excellent overall with a (hopefully) temporary glitch.

The battery backup is very poor at present. Tried tweaking multiple things including changing the performance profile to ""Light"" instead of ""Standard"". That seems to help a bit. But, it's nowhere near the 7-8 hours of screen on time reported in most Youtube reviews and user experience.

My old device was a Xiaomi Redmi K20 Pro, which I exchanged for this. It had more than 100 apps installed and even with that the battery was pretty good. In this phone I have installed only a very few apps until now, so very surprised by the battery life.

Many online forums including Samsung Members app have multiple reports of the same. Seems like its after the Feb 2023 update, hope it'll be fixed in their next update.(fingers crossed)

Other than that it has been a very satisfying and really good experience with butter smooth animations and quick app loading, awesome screen and multimedia content from apps like Netflix is a treat to watch on it. And the ""Expert raw"" app is a beast at grabbing unprecedented level of detailing. Even if I use jpg output from it, it's still far ahead than the regular Camera app in it. However, the default camera app is also pretty solid. The camera images and videos in low light is pretty good.

Another thing I liked is that most of the Samsung apps(that comes by default) which is not needed can be uninstalled.

Note: One thing I learnt the hard way: If you're applying a screen guard/tempered glass afterwards, do register your fingerprint again for best detection.

I really like the way the laptop is designed slim and compact. And it’s performance is perfect for my day to day use. Moreover the screen is so good to watch my favourite shows and YouTube videos.

The slim and compact design of the laptop helps me carry it around almost anywhere with hassle. I’ve also used it for light gaming!!!! SUPER HAPPY to have the Idea pad Slim 5 and excited to be part of the Lenovo family.

1. You don't get one year warranty with the laptop as it is mentioned with the item. But Amazon from its end nominally give you a warranty for one year which won't be reflected in Lenovo Vantage. In order to get your justiciable warranty, you need to struggle a lot with Lenovo. They will ask you 1000 and 100 proofs. If you are not concerned about warranty then you can buy this laptop.
2. This laptop doesn't support Alexa. I tried but I failed. Finally I found that this laptop is not compatible with Alexa.
3. There are many 2024 year manufactured laptops are there. Buy a good one. If you still want this 2023 August manufacture model, then go ahead and buy. It can be a good museum piece in your home.
4. Finally it is your choice to buy headache and tension or a good advanced model of some other company.

Pros:

Can’t really play any games on it. But have a gaming system for those needs.

I got this laptop for everyday use and light office applications like PowerPoint and Excel. It’s super lightweight and I can carry it anywhere I need to without hurting my shoulders.

Pros:
Lightweight
Great Screen
No lag when using most applications

Cons:
Can’t really play any games on it. But have a gaming system for those needs.

 Fantastic Phone - Best Compact Phone Period.

This is probably the best 6.1 inch phone your money can buy and most premium phone in android. I am sure it will beat apple too in value for money.
Got this phone for 50,800 after all the discount and exchanging my Oneplus 7T.

* Build quality is just strong with aluminum frame and gorilla glass victus on both sides.
* Display is full HD and is very pleasing to use. This is the best brightness I have experienced with 1750 nits. 120hz makes the user experience so fluid.
* Storage of 256GB with UFS 4.0 and 8GB RAM makes the phone usage buttery smooth.
* Cameras are top notch and software does a great job is delivering brilliant pictures.
* BATTERY !! Yay this is the best part of this phone and what it can deliver with combination of QCOM Snadragon 8 gen 2 and 3900mah battery. The battery can most likely last 2 days for most common use cases.
* Software experience has been improved with one UI and feels great. The updates are provided for 5 years which is longest in android world.

Overall definitely recommend this phone as its the best compact android phone in 2023 your money can buy especially with all the discounts its pure value for money.
Samsung nailed it with S23 series this year. Kudos !!

 Compact and sensible smartphone
Reviewed in India on 9 May 2023
Colour: GreenSize: 256GBPattern Name: PhoneVerified Purchase
The Samsung Galaxy S23 is an excellent choice for anyone who's looking for a one-handed and compact smartphone. The ease of using with one hand and the screen area available for use is just about right.
I have listed some points from my usage after 2 months of use - it involves everything except gaming.

What's good about the device?
1. Communications - Network reception is really good. It is very power efficient in 4G mode with SOT more than 8 hours.
Wifi, NFC, casting, Samsung DeX- all of these work reliably well.
5G Communication is also excellent but the SOT with active 5G use drops to around 6 hours.

2. Display - it is good, but it would have been even better if the panel would have been the same from S23 Ultra.

3. Battery life - excellent with normal usage. With calls, 4G and WiFi, and lots of streaming, it easily lasts a day. SOT of 9-10 hours can be obtained quite easily when connected to WiFi. On 5G network, obviously it'll drop off a bit.

4. Performance - Excellent so far. No issues whatsoever.

5. Samsung Pay - excellent features, easy to use, and I don't need to carry my wallet anymore.

6. Camera - takes excellent pictures. Even the night mode works very well.

What's not so good?
1. Charger is missing in the box. OEMs who actually care about sustainability should not copy Apple (or others) and it's ridiculous decisions.

2. Display - sometimes the display seems unresponsive in various apps. Although it is easily fixed by switching between apps or worst case, restarting the app. Not sure if it is hardware related or app related. Not all apps have this issue.
When it happens, it's quite annoying.

However, at the end of the day, I'm happy to have a compact and reliable phone with good network reception and excellent battery life!

 True flagship performance and excellent overall with a (hopefully) temporary glitch.
Reviewed in India on 8 March 2023

The battery backup is very poor at present. Tried tweaking multiple things including changing the performance profile to ""Light"" instead of ""Standard"". That seems to help a bit. But, it's nowhere near the 7-8 hours of screen on time reported in most Youtube reviews and user experience.

My old device was a Xiaomi Redmi K20 Pro, which I exchanged for this. It had more than 100 apps installed and even with that the battery was pretty good. In this phone I have installed only a very few apps until now, so very surprised by the battery life.

Many online forums including Samsung Members app have multiple reports of the same. Seems like its after the Feb 2023 update, hope it'll be fixed in their next update.(fingers crossed)

Other than that it has been a very satisfying and really good experience with butter smooth animations and quick app loading, awesome screen and multimedia content from apps like Netflix is a treat to watch on it. And the ""Expert raw"" app is a beast at grabbing unprecedented level of detailing. Even if I use jpg output from it, it's still far ahead than the regular Camera app in it. However, the default camera app is also pretty solid. The camera images and videos in low light is pretty good.

Another thing I liked is that most of the Samsung apps(that comes by default) which is not needed can be uninstalled.

Note: One thing I learnt the hard way: If you're applying a screen guard/tempered glass afterwards, do register your fingerprint again for best detection.

 Points to know before you purchase Lenovo laptop on Amazon stores:
Reviewed in India on 29 July 2024
Colour: CloudVerified Purchase
1. You don't get one year warranty with the laptop as it is mentioned with the item. But Amazon from its end nominally give you a warranty for one year which won't be reflected in Lenovo Vantage. In order to get your justiciable warranty, you need to struggle a lot with Lenovo. They will ask you 1000 and 100 proofs. If you are not concerned about warranty then you can buy this laptop.
2. This laptop doesn't support Alexa. I tried but I failed. Finally I found that this laptop is not compatible with Alexa.
3. There are many 2024 year manufactured laptops are there. Buy a good one. If you still want this 2023 August manufacture model, then go ahead and buy. It can be a good museum piece in your home.
4. Finally it is your choice to buy headache and tension or a good advanced model of some other company.

JBL Over-Ear Headphones

I recently purchased a pair of JBL over-ear headphones, and I couldn’t be more pleased with my decision. These headphones deliver exceptional sound quality, with deep bass and crisp highs that truly enhance my listening experience, whether I’m enjoying music, podcasts, or movies.

The comfort level is impressive, too. The ear cushions are soft and plush, making them perfect for long listening sessions without causing any discomfort. The adjustable headband ensures a secure fit, which is great for both casual use and more active settings.

Battery life is another standout feature; I easily get several hours of use on a single charge, and the quick charging option is a lifesaver when I’m in a hurry. The wireless connectivity is seamless, with no noticeable lag or dropouts during use.

Additionally, the build quality feels sturdy yet lightweight, making them portable for travel. The included carrying case is a nice touch for protection on the go.

Overall, the JBL over-ear headphones are an excellent choice for anyone looking for high-quality sound and comfort. Highly recommended!

 For a casual usage its the best option
Reviewed in India on 1 January 2024
Colour: BlueVerified Purchase
i have been using this ANC headphone for 3 months. there are many things i would like to share.

Lets break down the few factors

built quality - solid shape for both ears (normal ear size) portable and it folds so u can save space. and it wont fall from the shoulders or while putting in ears and do workouts, it stays in your head perfectly. not water resistant or proof however it is sweat proof and dust proof

Comfort- solid design for a normal ear size and cushions are soft but more than 4-5 hours without taking off use may leads to getting warm. it is basically weightless doesn't hurt head or ear its a nice design actually

ANC- its will not suppress complete surrounding sounds but ye does the job this price range, above 80% volume will turn off the anc to deliver high volume sound

sound quality- never disappoints, its JBL. when u connect using bluetooth .headphone sets around 80% of volume people do complaint about low volume in headphone. u can increase in headphone using physical buttons, however the anc will automatically turn off. the bass is great

App support- doesn't give you JBL app support but in lower models such as JBL Live 670N, JBL 500 BT and higher model such as 770NC , JBL Tune 670NC JBL Tune 770NC only has them

Connections- dual connection is supported u can connect in your lap and mobile at the same time and listen from a device one at a time. and fast pairing in smartphones is so good and u can locate device on find my device too its a good feature

charging- fast charging is supported so for 5 minutes u will get playback time about 2 hours and total charging time takes about half an hour. while charging it heats and cool down
While charging u cant use Bluetooth and the design of the headset also not meant for that
u can use aux after the headset is dead

mic- good for calls and small use it isnt that good especially in windy places (example under the fan in a room) not good for professional use

CONCLUSION
its good for all rounder headphone in this price range. Don't listen what others says even though there are some limitations but its prefect in many aspect. perfect for photographic materiel too. after a full charge i use it for 4 days roughly. if u have budget go for it

 Sound quality is good on wired mode but really bad on wireless mode.
Reviewed in India on 4 August 2024
Colour: BlueVerified Purchase
Just after unboxing, I tested the headphone. On wireless mode, I didn't find the sound quality to be as great as I expected it to be. The noice cancellation was also not exceptional. The main problem was that when I plugged in the audio cable, I found out that the right earcup of the headphone was not working at all. It was because of loose-connection (inside headphones) somewhere I guess. I decided to give it some time before I tested it once again. This time, the wireless mode sound quality dropped significantly (On sharp beats, it started producing cracking sounds). This time on wired mode, both the earcups worked fine and the sound quality was really good. After 2-3 days of usage, cracking sound is still there on wireless mode. Overall I am not satisfied with these headphones. I would recommend not investing such an amount in JBL headphones but rather to go for budget earphones. I don't think JBL puts their best efforts in this price range. If you really want high quality, go for a high-price flagship model.

 Well budgeted ANC headphones with lots of good features
Reviewed in India on 22 October 2023
Colour: BlackVerified Purchase
Pros: good sturdy build and good connectivity and battery life, and aesthetically looks good on you. Active Noise Cancelling is great too.

Cons (likely):

* Charging port doesn't allow for using while charging. I had this in my last headphones (non-brand, cheaper!) and it's so convenient that you miss it and curse whoever is lacking behind in this basic feature. But the good battery backup leaves you plenty time to recharge.

* Too tight. Again, a basic feature IMO to make it feather light which again, a lot of cheaper non-brand headphones are offering, such a shame to see it lacking too. Ears will get hot even in winter/AC. But great if you're a runner, they won't come off.

* Multipoint connection is better than others as it allows you to fully switch between two devices rather divide the audio between calling and music mode. BUT again, the only downside (that maybe only I'm seeing on my Windows PC) that when I switch away from it to my phone, my pc gets entirely disconnected (unlike Android that puts the connection on standby) and I have to re-connect from windows after switching back to it.

* Very little bass. And I feel like ANC might me filtering some of it out, especially at large volume, as the most bass I get at is weirdly at ~80% volume.

Verdict: Well budgeted ANC headphones with lots of good features.

Exchange facility
Amazon exchange facility is much better than Flipkart. For the same old fridge (which was 17 yrs old but in good working condition), Flipkart refused to accept saying there are a few (minor) rust marks at bottom of door whereas Amazon accepted without any fuss.

Price
After researching on various 335ltr models, decided on this one due to features and price. Bought on 24-Oct-20 for a effective price of INR 27,500 after exchange, discounts and card cashback.

Delivery & Installation
The new fridge was delivered in good condition without any scratch or damage. Since I was without a fridge when the new one was delivered at 12pm (old taken away in exchange), the LG technician accepted my request to come the same day (at 4pm) and install the new one. I am thankful for this excellent gesture on his part.

Pros
The fridge area is spacious and feels bigger than the earlier LG 390 ltrs model which I was using. This is becos of the more shelves in this model. The pull out tray and the convertible box (above the veg bin) are very useful. The cooling at mid settings is good. The external look in very elegant. The build quality is very good and the fridge has sturdy look overall.

Cons
The vegetable / fruit storage bin at the bottom seems constricted in size and does not move freely. The inside area of freezer compartment also seems smaller as compared to the view from outside. The ice trays / storage occupy much space. No light in the freezer - not sure why LG does not install (even my 17 yr old did not have) inspite of its usefulness and every review mentioning this as a drawback. The user manual is very basic and does not explain the high / low feature in the convertible box / veg bin.

Overall
Though the cons look more, they are not so significant as compared to the good features. I am satisfied with this model and will recommend it.

I got damaged product and I placed for return, I’m not blaming LG company, from the LG, everything is fine, I’m talking about the delhivery company, it took nearly half a month to pickup a product, the wooooooorst agent and the wooooorst company, to delivery a refrigerator, only one person is it enough? But Amazon apps says two people will come to deliver. Before signing any contract, Amazon have to do background check up, Now a days every company doing background check up, for a small small postions. I think this company don’t even have an application where the agent can send a pic of the Customer building, so that it confirms he or she visited the customer location, they gave another option like contact was made but unable to reach customer, wooooow amazing, if he made a contact to the customer, this company app should witness the customer number, in this way should confirm, because of I’m staying in 2nd floor, they don’t want to deliver on the floor, then why Amazon accepting the order, if they are charging for the 2nd, 1st floor separately, we are ok to pay but this a wooooorst company where only one person delivering the refrigerator. What if the senior citizens staying on 2nd floor.
After reading this review people will think that , it’s not a company mistake, it’s mistake of agents.
Woooooooow
Keeping this I have asked few questions with agents he said, company only saying that not to deliver the product on the 2nd floor separately, deliver on ground floor, it doesn’t matter where they are staying.
From this I understood, company thinking about money not about growing in the future.
So, Amazon has open their eyes, think once again to do business with this wooooorst company.

Thank you.

The fan is powerful enough and works fine. The problem is that it is entirely made of plastic. It tips over quite easily. This means the covers for the fan blades come apart very easily - and it takes a while to put together.
At this price point, you cannot expect it to be noiseless - so no comment on that.

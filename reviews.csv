Product is very good but I will suggest if you are paying 13000 and purchasing in online mode then pls pay 2000 more and go offline and buy from shop. They will give you same model but built quality and RAM and ROM will be more updated version. Also remember if you think online and offline products are same then you are wrong.

 Great quality tv at a decent price but lacks alof of features

Size: 32 inches | HD Smart Bezel-less DesignVerified Purchase
NOTE: TV TABLE STAND IS NOT PROVIDED IN THE BOX. No Bluetooth support. Only wifi 2.4ghz is supported, no 5ghz wifi support. PICTURE & AUDIO quality is SUPERB. Supports dolby and hdr.
Buy this Only if u want reliability (samsung displays are very reliable and last long unlike cheap counterparts) , good picture and audio quality.

Bought the bezel less 2022 variant for 14,990 rupees.
Samsung is a reliable brand. Picture & quality is good. Although it's not a full hd 1080p display, at 32 inches its not apparent.

User interface is okay. Netflix app works smooth but prime video app is laggy. Tizen os is fine. So no google play store. Doesn't support chromecast, only supports Mira cast which is a different casting protocol.

Feature wise tizen os is bare minimum. But you can easily buy an android tv box to get google play functionality if u want to run android apps.

Brands like tcl, ifalconn, redmi offer more features because they run google tv\ android tv but their hardware is not reliable.

This samsung 32inches tv is great deal if u buy at 14k inr. Great picture clarity. Good sound quality. HDR works good. Samsung has great after sales customer service. So if u want good quality and reliable TV and don't care too much about having android tv os, go for this. It's a great product.

Product was intact, delivery was smooth. Open box inspection was done. It was delivered to our room where it was to be installed. It had all accessories except wall-top mount/table top, but that was provided by the Samsung , free of cost.
Display, Performance, Remote control all are functioning properly as till date. Picture quality, Sound, etc., are good too. Since it's a HD and Smart TV, the Samsung Engineer installed the Smart App and so, we can see YouTube, Samsung Tv and an other channel or two without making an account, but Netflix, and others need an account for viewing. But his is no problem. Because I purchased it for my parents and they aren't interested in watching those channels at all. The Samsung Tv has 150 channels, starting from 1000. I viewed them one by one. All were good, mostly in English. I am impressed. üëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüòÅüòÅüòÅ
The Samsung Engineer helped us a lot, in other things too, like removing the set-top box stand from one room to fix in their room, and adjusting all wires, audio-visual pins and plugs, etc.. But this was not included in his service, so, we paid him for the extra service, though he was quite reluctant to accept the payment. You know, his service included only in installing Tv and downloading Smart App to start the function. But the other service wasn't included. He did it as kindness towards us, and we paid him as a token of gratitude. With God's Grace, all was done smoothly. Thanks to Lord for providing help in his form. And thanks to dealer and Samsung brand too for providing such service. üëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüôèüôèüôèüôèüôè üíêüíêüíêüíêüíê

Upgrading to the iPhone 16 was an absolute breeze! Apple has once again refined the transition process, making data transfer from my old iPhone effortless. With just a few taps, everything‚Äîfrom apps to settings‚Äîmoved over flawlessly, making the switch feel seamless.

The performance is top-notch, with unparalleled smoothness in navigation, app responsiveness, and multitasking. The enhanced battery life, display quality, and camera features make it a worthy upgrade for anyone looking for the best smartphone experience.

If you‚Äôre considering an upgrade, the iPhone 16 won‚Äôt disappoint. Apple continues to set the standard for premium smartphones! Highly recommended!

 Poor Seller Experience
Reviewed in India on 15 March 2025
Colour: UltramarineSize: 128 GBVerified Purchase
I am writing to formally complain about my recent purchase of an iPhone 16 from online on Amazon.
I received the item on the same day of purchase, but upon unboxing, I noticed that the iPhone came in a mismatched (muddled) box. When I powered it on, the phone was stuck on the ‚ÄúHello‚Äù screen, repeatedly displaying ‚ÄúHello‚Äù in multiple languages. It was completely unresponsive‚Äînone of the buttons, including the power and volume buttons, were functioning.

After approximately five hours, the battery finally drained, and the phone shut down. However, after restarting, the same issue persisted, with the device stuck on the ‚ÄúHello‚Äù screen again.

I contacted Amazon‚Äôs support team, who advised me to reach out to Apple Support. Apple Support suggested some troubleshooting steps, but none resolved the issue. Ultimately, they advised me to visit an Apple-authorized service center for a software reinstallation‚Äîon a brand-new phone.

I then had to travel 5 km to a Maple (Apple-authorized) service center, where they reinstalled the software. The process took about 45‚Äì50 minutes, finally making the phone functional.

I am extremely disappointed with this experience. After purchasing a costly device, I suffered an entire day of inconvenience due to the seller‚Äôs inefficiency or the company‚Äôs negligence in quality control. This is unacceptable, especially for a premium product.

Previously, I had purchased an iPhone 15 online without any issues, but this time, the experience was frustrating and disappointing. I strongly urge you to take action against this seller for supplying what appears to be old or improperly stored stock.

I request appropriate compensation for the inconvenience and mental stress caused. Additionally, I advise other customers to be cautious when purchasing from this seller.

I hope Amazon takes this matter seriously and ensures such incidents do not happen again.

Product was intact, delivery was smooth. Open box inspection was done. It was delivered to our room where it was to be installed. It had all accessories except wall-top mount/table top, but that was provided by the Samsung , free of cost.
Display, Performance, Remote control all are functioning properly as till date. Picture quality, Sound, etc., are good too. Since it's a HD and Smart TV, the Samsung Engineer installed the Smart App and so, we can see YouTube, Samsung Tv and an other channel or two without making an account, but Netflix, and others need an account for viewing. But his is no problem. Because I purchased it for my parents and they aren't interested in watching those channels at all. The Samsung Tv has 150 channels, starting from 1000. I viewed them one by one. All were good, mostly in English. I am impressed. üëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüòÅüòÅüòÅ
The Samsung Engineer helped us a lot, in other things too, like removing the set-top box stand from one room to fix in their room, and adjusting all wires, audio-visual pins and plugs, etc.. But this was not included in his service, so, we paid him for the extra service, though he was quite reluctant to accept the payment. You know, his service included only in installing Tv and downloading Smart App to start the function. But the other service wasn't included. He did it as kindness towards us, and we paid him as a token of gratitude. With God's Grace, all was done smoothly. Thanks to Lord for providing help in his form. And thanks to dealer and Samsung brand too for providing such service. üëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüôèüôèüôèüôèüôè üíêüíêüíêüíêüíê

 Poor Seller Experience
Reviewed in India on 15 March 2025
Colour: UltramarineSize: 128 GBVerified Purchase
I am writing to formally complain about my recent purchase of an iPhone 16 from online on Amazon.
I received the item on the same day of purchase, but upon unboxing, I noticed that the iPhone came in a mismatched (muddled) box. When I powered it on, the phone was stuck on the ‚ÄúHello‚Äù screen, repeatedly displaying ‚ÄúHello‚Äù in multiple languages. It was completely unresponsive‚Äînone of the buttons, including the power and volume buttons, were functioning.

After approximately five hours, the battery finally drained, and the phone shut down. However, after restarting, the same issue persisted, with the device stuck on the ‚ÄúHello‚Äù screen again.

I contacted Amazon‚Äôs support team, who advised me to reach out to Apple Support. Apple Support suggested some troubleshooting steps, but none resolved the issue. Ultimately, they advised me to visit an Apple-authorized service center for a software reinstallation‚Äîon a brand-new phone.

I then had to travel 5 km to a Maple (Apple-authorized) service center, where they reinstalled the software. The process took about 45‚Äì50 minutes, finally making the phone functional.

I am extremely disappointed with this experience. After purchasing a costly device, I suffered an entire day of inconvenience due to the seller‚Äôs inefficiency or the company‚Äôs negligence in quality control. This is unacceptable, especially for a premium product.

Previously, I had purchased an iPhone 15 online without any issues, but this time, the experience was frustrating and disappointing. I strongly urge you to take action against this seller for supplying what appears to be old or improperly stored stock.

I request appropriate compensation for the inconvenience and mental stress caused. Additionally, I advise other customers to be cautious when purchasing from this seller.

I hope Amazon takes this matter seriously and ensures such incidents do not happen again.

I‚Äôve been using the Noise Pro 6 Max Smart Watch for a few weeks now, and it‚Äôs been a fantastic experience! The 1.96‚Äù AMOLED display is crisp and vibrant, making everything easy to read, even in bright sunlight. The stainless steel build gives it a premium look and feel‚Äîdefinitely a step up from plastic models.

The AI companion is surprisingly responsive, and I love the endless AI watch faces that let me customize the look to match my mood. The built-in GPS is accurate, which makes it perfect for outdoor workouts, and the 5 ATM water resistance gives me peace of mind during workouts and rainy days.

The EN2 Processor ensures smooth performance, with no lag when switching between apps. Plus, it works seamlessly with both iOS and Android devices, which is a huge plus.

Overall, this smartwatch offers great value for money with its advanced features and sleek design. Highly recommended! ‚åöüíØ

NOTE: TV TABLE STAND IS NOT PROVIDED IN THE BOX. No Bluetooth support. Only wifi 2.4ghz is supported, no 5ghz wifi support. PICTURE & AUDIO quality is SUPERB. Supports dolby and hdr.
Buy this Only if u want reliability (samsung displays are very reliable and last long unlike cheap counterparts) , good picture and audio quality.

Bought the bezel less 2022 variant for 14,990 rupees.
Samsung is a reliable brand. Picture & quality is good. Although it's not a full hd 1080p display, at 32 inches its not apparent.

User interface is okay. Netflix app works smooth but prime video app is laggy. Tizen os is fine. So no google play store. Doesn't support chromecast, only supports Mira cast which is a different casting protocol.

Feature wise tizen os is bare minimum. But you can easily buy an android tv box to get google play functionality if u want to run android apps.

Brands like tcl, ifalconn, redmi offer more features because they run google tv\ android tv but their hardware is not reliable.

This samsung 32inches tv is great deal if u buy at 14k inr. Great picture clarity. Good sound quality. HDR works good. Samsung has great after sales customer service. So if u want good quality and reliable TV and don't care too much about having android tv os, go for this. It's a great product.

I contacted Amazon‚Äôs support team, who advised me to reach out to Apple Support. Apple Support suggested some troubleshooting steps, but none resolved the issue. Ultimately, they advised me to visit an Apple-authorized service center for a software reinstallation‚Äîon a brand-new phone.

I then had to travel 5 km to a Maple (Apple-authorized) service center, where they reinstalled the software. The process took about 45‚Äì50 minutes, finally making the phone functional.

I am extremely disappointed with this experience. After purchasing a costly device, I suffered an entire day of inconvenience due to the seller‚Äôs inefficiency or the company‚Äôs negligence in quality control. This is unacceptable, especially for a premium product.

Previously, I had purchased an iPhone 15 online without any issues, but this time, the experience was frustrating and disappointing. I strongly urge you to take action against this seller for supplying what appears to be old or improperly stored stock.

I request appropriate compensation for the inconvenience and mental stress caused. Additionally, I advise other customers to be cautious when purchasing from this seller.

I hope Amazon takes this matter seriously and ensures such incidents do not happen again.

Product is very good but I will suggest if you are paying 13000 and purchasing in online mode then pls pay 2000 more and go offline and buy from shop. They will give you same model but built quality and RAM and ROM will be more updated version. Also remember if you think online and offline products are same then you are wrong.

NOTE: TV TABLE STAND IS NOT PROVIDED IN THE BOX. No Bluetooth support. Only wifi 2.4ghz is supported, no 5ghz wifi support. PICTURE & AUDIO quality is SUPERB. Supports dolby and hdr.
Buy this Only if u want reliability (samsung displays are very reliable and last long unlike cheap counterparts) , good picture and audio quality.

Bought the bezel less 2022 variant for 14,990 rupees.
Samsung is a reliable brand. Picture & quality is good. Although it's not a full hd 1080p display, at 32 inches its not apparent.

User interface is okay. Netflix app works smooth but prime video app is laggy. Tizen os is fine. So no google play store. Doesn't support chromecast, only supports Mira cast which is a different casting protocol.

Feature wise tizen os is bare minimum. But you can easily buy an android tv box to get google play functionality if u want to run android apps.

Brands like tcl, ifalconn, redmi offer more features because they run google tv\ android tv but their hardware is not reliable.

This samsung 32inches tv is great deal if u buy at 14k inr. Great picture clarity. Good sound quality. HDR works good. Samsung has great after sales customer service. So if u want good quality and reliable TV and don't care too much about having android tv os, go for this. It's a great product.

Product was intact, delivery was smooth. Open box inspection was done. It was delivered to our room where it was to be installed. It had all accessories except wall-top mount/table top, but that was provided by the Samsung , free of cost.
Display, Performance, Remote control all are functioning properly as till date. Picture quality, Sound, etc., are good too. Since it's a HD and Smart TV, the Samsung Engineer installed the Smart App and so, we can see YouTube, Samsung Tv and an other channel or two without making an account, but Netflix, and others need an account for viewing. But his is no problem. Because I purchased it for my parents and they aren't interested in watching those channels at all. The Samsung Tv has 150 channels, starting from 1000. I viewed them one by one. All were good, mostly in English. I am impressed. üëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüòÅüòÅüòÅ
The Samsung Engineer helped us a lot, in other things too, like removing the set-top box stand from one room to fix in their room, and adjusting all wires, audio-visual pins and plugs, etc.. But this was not included in his service, so, we paid him for the extra service, though he was quite reluctant to accept the payment. You know, his service included only in installing Tv and downloading Smart App to start the function. But the other service wasn't included. He did it as kindness towards us, and we paid him as a token of gratitude. With God's Grace, all was done smoothly. Thanks to Lord for providing help in his form.

 5 Stars - Excellent Product and Exceptional Customer Service!
Reviewed in India on 27 June 2024
Style Name: 65-LitreVerified Purchase
I recently purchased the Crompton Optimus Desert Air Cooler (65L) and I'm thoroughly impressed with both the product and the seller's service.

Product Review:
The cooler is well-built with high-quality plastic that feels durable. The honeycomb pads are highly effective, efficiently cooling the room without excessive noise. A standout feature is the ice chamber conveniently located at the top, which enhances the cooling effect.
Initially, I encountered a minor issue with water distribution to the honeycomb pads. However, this leads me to the most impressive part of my experience - the customer service.

Seller Service:
When I shared the issue during their follow-up for a review, the seller's reaction was swift and customer-focused. They immediately offered to replace the cooler, no questions asked. The next day, they sent someone to deliver a new unit and take back the faulty one.
This level of service went above and beyond my expectations. It was far more convenient than having to ship such a large item myself, which Amazon had initially suggested. The seller's proactive approach, quick resolution, and hassle-free replacement process were truly impressive.

I recommend both this cooler and this seller. The product is efficient and well-designed, and with this level of after-sales support, I couldn't be happier with my purchase. It's refreshing to see a company that stands behind their product and prioritizes customer satisfaction to this degree.

Reviewed in India on 9 March 2025
Style Name: 100-LitreVerified Purchase
Plastic Material Discrepancy:
Notably, the ice chamber and cover are constructed from noticeably different plastics, both in texture and color. The chamber boasts a sturdier feel, while the cover feels flimsy and is of a distinctly different hue. This inconsistency in material quality is concerning, particularly for a product of this nature.

Cover Fitment Issues:
The cover's inability to close properly is a recurring annoyance, requiring undue force to secure it in place. Furthermore, its bent appearance near the corners suggests a lack of precision in the manufacturing process, leading to frustration during use.

Mosquito Net Blockage: Examination reveals that portions of the mosquito netting are completely sealed off, raising doubts about the effectiveness of ventilation. Such blockages could impede airflow to the honeycomb pad, potentially compromising the unit's cooling capabilities and placing undue strain on the fan mechanism.

Body Gaps:
Upon closer inspection, it becomes evident that there are multiple areas where the various components of the body fail to align seamlessly. These visible gaps suggest a lack of attention to detail during assembly, detracting from the product's overall aesthetic and functionality.

2 days am used this product ....
Cooling wise it's so wonderful am filling light hot water inside the chamber but output it's give cooling & breeze air .
First day approximately I filled 60-62 ltr water afternoon 1 to evening 8 o clock it's continuously running and comes under min level.

Second day filled 60 LTR water using at night time
9 pm to morning 5 am .
So average 8 hours it's running full tank capacity.

Noise wise quit good . Very pleasant .

First day full of honeycomb smell in hall .
But second day it's not in machine .
So smell so horrible at day 1 . So pls out of children from this cooler day 1.

Before operate & run the aircooler kindly check bottom chamber I identified two screw inside the water chamber.
I dont know how it's happened may be travelling time it may be happen .
So before check water chamber then you run it your cooler.

Note : Water issue area people & metro people
per day it's consump 60 ltr water so cost it around
25*3 water cane = 60 ruppes
60*30 days = 1800 rupees
+
Current bill consumption you add so total it around 2100 RS it's come monthly charge .
So my personal opinion
If you need aircooler for your home think & buy.
If water problem not in your area.
If water problem is there in your area kindly think and buy .

Thankyou

 PLASTIC FAN with ordinary plastic body and cheap workmanship
Reviewed in India on 15 March 2025
Style Name: 100-LitreVerified Purchase
The fan should be always metal. I had upgraded from Ozone 75 to this assuming blindly that the fan would be metal as was with the earlier. The fan is made of plastic and has only 3 wings. My old ozone 75 had 5 metal wings. The plastic was better, and over-all workmanship was good. The plastic here is flimsy and has lots of semi finished parts to it. There are a lot of gaps everywhere, the front grill is having so big gaps that a small kid can easily put his/her hands in as the louvers are way too flexible. Throw is ok, sound is reduced a bit. But thoroughly disappointed. Thought Crompton knew how to make a desert cooler. I guess I should have relied on my local, super trusterd Nagpur cooler vendor, Ram Coolers. Just hoping the motor should be good as I am thinking of changing the fan soon. Hope I can trust Crompton with atleast the fan motors.

Product is very good but I will suggest if you are paying 13000 and purchasing in online mode then pls pay 2000 more and go offline and buy from shop. They will give you same model but built quality and RAM and ROM will be more updated version. Also remember if you think online and offline products are same then you are wrong.

Size: 32 inches | HD Smart Bezel-less DesignVerified Purchase
NOTE: TV TABLE STAND IS NOT PROVIDED IN THE BOX. No Bluetooth support. Only wifi 2.4ghz is supported, no 5ghz wifi support. PICTURE & AUDIO quality is SUPERB. Supports dolby and hdr.
Buy this Only if u want reliability (samsung displays are very reliable and last long unlike cheap counterparts) , good picture and audio quality.

Bought the bezel less 2022 variant for 14,990 rupees.
Samsung is a reliable brand. Picture & quality is good. Although it's not a full hd 1080p display, at 32 inches its not apparent.

User interface is okay. Netflix app works smooth but prime video app is laggy. Tizen os is fine. So no google play store. Doesn't support chromecast, only supports Mira cast which is a different casting protocol.

Feature wise tizen os is bare minimum. But you can easily buy an android tv box to get google play functionality if u want to run android apps.

Brands like tcl, ifalconn, redmi offer more features because they run google tv\ android tv but their hardware is not reliable.

This samsung 32inches tv is great deal if u buy at 14k inr. Great picture clarity. Good sound quality. HDR works good. Samsung has great after sales customer service. So if u want good quality and reliable TV and don't care too much about having android tv os, go for this. It's a great product.

Product was intact, delivery was smooth. Open box inspection was done. It was delivered to our room where it was to be installed. It had all accessories except wall-top mount/table top, but that was provided by the Samsung , free of cost.
Display, Performance, Remote control all are functioning properly as till date. Picture quality, Sound, etc., are good too. Since it's a HD and Smart TV, the Samsung Engineer installed the Smart App and so, we can see YouTube, Samsung Tv and an other channel or two without making an account, but Netflix, and others need an account for viewing. But his is no problem. Because I purchased it for my parents and they aren't interested in watching those channels at all. The Samsung Tv has 150 channels, starting from 1000. I viewed them one by one. All were good, mostly in English. I am impressed. üëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüòÅüòÅüòÅ
The Samsung Engineer helped us a lot, in other things too, like removing the set-top box stand from one room to fix in their room, and adjusting all wires, audio-visual pins and plugs, etc.. But this was not included in his service, so, we paid him for the extra service, though he was quite reluctant to accept the payment. You know, his service included only in installing Tv and downloading Smart App to start the function. But the other service wasn't included. He did it as kindness towards us, and we paid him as a token of gratitude. With God's Grace, all was done smoothly. Thanks to Lord for providing help in his form. And thanks to dealer and Samsung brand too for providing such service. üëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüôèüôèüôèüôèüôè üíêüíêüíêüíêüíê

 Poor Seller Experience
Reviewed in India on 15 March 2025
Colour: UltramarineSize: 128 GBVerified Purchase
I am writing to formally complain about my recent purchase of an iPhone 16 from online on Amazon.
I received the item on the same day of purchase, but upon unboxing, I noticed that the iPhone came in a mismatched (muddled) box. When I powered it on, the phone was stuck on the ‚ÄúHello‚Äù screen, repeatedly displaying ‚ÄúHello‚Äù in multiple languages. It was completely unresponsive‚Äînone of the buttons, including the power and volume buttons, were functioning.

After approximately five hours, the battery finally drained, and the phone shut down. However, after restarting, the same issue persisted, with the device stuck on the ‚ÄúHello‚Äù screen again.

I contacted Amazon‚Äôs support team, who advised me to reach out to Apple Support. Apple Support suggested some troubleshooting steps, but none resolved the issue. Ultimately, they advised me to visit an Apple-authorized service center for a software reinstallation‚Äîon a brand-new phone.

I then had to travel 5 km to a Maple (Apple-authorized) service center, where they reinstalled the software. The process took about 45‚Äì50 minutes, finally making the phone functional.

I am extremely disappointed with this experience. After purchasing a costly device, I suffered an entire day of inconvenience due to the seller‚Äôs inefficiency or the company‚Äôs negligence in quality control. This is unacceptable, especially for a premium product.

Previously, I had purchased an iPhone 15 online without any issues, but this time, the experience was frustrating and disappointing. I strongly urge you to take action against this seller for supplying what appears to be old or improperly stored stock.

I request appropriate compensation for the inconvenience and mental stress caused. Additionally, I advise other customers to be cautious when purchasing from this seller.

I hope Amazon takes this matter seriously and ensures such incidents do not happen again.

 Great quality tv at a decent price but lacks alof of features

Size: 32 inches | HD Smart Bezel-less DesignVerified Purchase
NOTE: TV TABLE STAND IS NOT PROVIDED IN THE BOX. No Bluetooth support. Only wifi 2.4ghz is supported, no 5ghz wifi support. PICTURE & AUDIO quality is SUPERB. Supports dolby and hdr.
Buy this Only if u want reliability (samsung displays are very reliable and last long unlike cheap counterparts) , good picture and audio quality.

Bought the bezel less 2022 variant for 14,990 rupees.
Samsung is a reliable brand. Picture & quality is good. Although it's not a full hd 1080p display, at 32 inches its not apparent.

User interface is okay. Netflix app works smooth but prime video app is laggy. Tizen os is fine. So no google play store. Doesn't support chromecast, only supports Mira cast which is a different casting protocol.

Feature wise tizen os is bare minimum. But you can easily buy an android tv box to get google play functionality if u want to run android apps.

Brands like tcl, ifalconn, redmi offer more features because they run google tv\ android tv but their hardware is not reliable.

This samsung 32inches tv is great deal if u buy at 14k inr. Great picture clarity. Good sound quality. HDR works good. Samsung has great after sales customer service. So if u want good quality and reliable TV and don't care too much about having android tv os, go for this. It's a great product.

Product was intact, delivery was smooth. Open box inspection was done. It was delivered to our room where it was to be installed. It had all accessories except wall-top mount/table top, but that was provided by the Samsung , free of cost.
Display, Performance, Remote control all are functioning properly as till date. Picture quality, Sound, etc., are good too. Since it's a HD and Smart TV, the Samsung Engineer installed the Smart App and so, we can see YouTube, Samsung Tv and an other channel or two without making an account, but Netflix, and others need an account for viewing. But his is no problem. Because I purchased it for my parents and they aren't interested in watching those channels at all. The Samsung Tv has 150 channels, starting from 1000. I viewed them one by one. All were good, mostly in English. I am impressed. üëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüòÅüòÅüòÅ
The Samsung Engineer helped us a lot, in other things too, like removing the set-top box stand from one room to fix in their room, and adjusting all wires, audio-visual pins and plugs, etc.. But this was not included in his service, so, we paid him for the extra service, though he was quite reluctant to accept the payment. You know, his service included only in installing Tv and downloading Smart App to start the function. But the other service wasn't included. He did it as kindness towards us, and we paid him as a token of gratitude. With God's Grace, all was done smoothly. Thanks to Lord for providing help in his form. And thanks to dealer and Samsung brand too for providing such service. üëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüôèüôèüôèüôèüôè üíêüíêüíêüíêüíê

 Poor Seller Experience
Reviewed in India on 15 March 2025
Colour: UltramarineSize: 128 GBVerified Purchase
I am writing to formally complain about my recent purchase of an iPhone 16 from online on Amazon.
I received the item on the same day of purchase, but upon unboxing, I noticed that the iPhone came in a mismatched (muddled) box. When I powered it on, the phone was stuck on the ‚ÄúHello‚Äù screen, repeatedly displaying ‚ÄúHello‚Äù in multiple languages. It was completely unresponsive‚Äînone of the buttons, including the power and volume buttons, were functioning.

After approximately five hours, the battery finally drained, and the phone shut down. However, after restarting, the same issue persisted, with the device stuck on the ‚ÄúHello‚Äù screen again.

I contacted Amazon‚Äôs support team, who advised me to reach out to Apple Support. Apple Support suggested some troubleshooting steps, but none resolved the issue. Ultimately, they advised me to visit an Apple-authorized service center for a software reinstallation‚Äîon a brand-new phone.

I then had to travel 5 km to a Maple (Apple-authorized) service center, where they reinstalled the software. The process took about 45‚Äì50 minutes, finally making the phone functional.

I am extremely disappointed with this experience. After purchasing a costly device, I suffered an entire day of inconvenience due to the seller‚Äôs inefficiency or the company‚Äôs negligence in quality control. This is unacceptable, especially for a premium product.

Previously, I had purchased an iPhone 15 online without any issues, but this time, the experience was frustrating and disappointing. I strongly urge you to take action against this seller for supplying what appears to be old or improperly stored stock.

I request appropriate compensation for the inconvenience and mental stress caused. Additionally, I advise other customers to be cautious when purchasing from this seller.

I hope Amazon takes this matter seriously and ensures such incidents do not happen again.

I‚Äôve been using the Noise Pro 6 Max Smart Watch for a few weeks now, and it‚Äôs been a fantastic experience! The 1.96‚Äù AMOLED display is crisp and vibrant, making everything easy to read, even in bright sunlight. The stainless steel build gives it a premium look and feel‚Äîdefinitely a step up from plastic models.

The AI companion is surprisingly responsive, and I love the endless AI watch faces that let me customize the look to match my mood. The built-in GPS is accurate, which makes it perfect for outdoor workouts, and the 5 ATM water resistance gives me peace of mind during workouts and rainy days.

The EN2 Processor ensures smooth performance, with no lag when switching between apps. Plus, it works seamlessly with both iOS and Android devices, which is a huge plus.

Overall, this smartwatch offers great value for money with its advanced features and sleek design. Highly recommended! ‚åöüíØ

 Poor Seller Experience
Reviewed in India on 15 March 2025
Colour: UltramarineSize: 128 GBVerified Purchase
I am writing to formally complain about my recent purchase of an iPhone 16 from online on Amazon.
I received the item on the same day of purchase, but upon unboxing, I noticed that the iPhone came in a mismatched (muddled) box. When I powered it on, the phone was stuck on the ‚ÄúHello‚Äù screen, repeatedly displaying ‚ÄúHello‚Äù in multiple languages. It was completely unresponsive‚Äînone of the buttons, including the power and volume buttons, were functioning.

After approximately five hours, the battery finally drained, and the phone shut down. However, after restarting, the same issue persisted, with the device stuck on the ‚ÄúHello‚Äù screen again.

I contacted Amazon‚Äôs support team, who advised me to reach out to Apple Support. Apple Support suggested some troubleshooting steps, but none resolved the issue. Ultimately, they advised me to visit an Apple-authorized service center for a software reinstallation‚Äîon a brand-new phone.

I then had to travel 5 km to a Maple (Apple-authorized) service center, where they reinstalled the software. The process took about 45‚Äì50 minutes, finally making the phone functional.

I am extremely disappointed with this experience. After purchasing a costly device, I suffered an entire day of inconvenience due to the seller‚Äôs inefficiency or the company‚Äôs negligence in quality control. This is unacceptable, especially for a premium product.

Previously, I had purchased an iPhone 15 online without any issues, but this time, the experience was frustrating and disappointing. I strongly urge you to take action against this seller for supplying what appears to be old or improperly stored stock.

I request appropriate compensation for the inconvenience and mental stress caused. Additionally, I advise other customers to be cautious when purchasing from this seller.

I hope Amazon takes this matter seriously and ensures such incidents do not happen again.

NOTE: TV TABLE STAND IS NOT PROVIDED IN THE BOX. No Bluetooth support. Only wifi 2.4ghz is supported, no 5ghz wifi support. PICTURE & AUDIO quality is SUPERB. Supports dolby and hdr.
Buy this Only if u want reliability (samsung displays are very reliable and last long unlike cheap counterparts) , good picture and audio quality.

Bought the bezel less 2022 variant for 14,990 rupees.
Samsung is a reliable brand. Picture & quality is good. Although it's not a full hd 1080p display, at 32 inches its not apparent.

User interface is okay. Netflix app works smooth but prime video app is laggy. Tizen os is fine. So no google play store. Doesn't support chromecast, only supports Mira cast which is a different casting protocol.

Feature wise tizen os is bare minimum. But you can easily buy an android tv box to get google play functionality if u want to run android apps.

Brands like tcl, ifalconn, redmi offer more features because they run google tv\ android tv but their hardware is not reliable.

This samsung 32inches tv is great deal if u buy at 14k inr. Great picture clarity. Good sound quality. HDR works good. Samsung has great after sales customer service. So if u want good quality and reliable TV and don't care too much about having android tv os, go for this. It's a great product.

Product was intact, delivery was smooth. Open box inspection was done. It was delivered to our room where it was to be installed. It had all accessories except wall-top mount/table top, but that was provided by the Samsung , free of cost.
Display, Performance, Remote control all are functioning properly as till date. Picture quality, Sound, etc., are good too. Since it's a HD and Smart TV, the Samsung Engineer installed the Smart App and so, we can see YouTube, Samsung Tv and an other channel or two without making an account, but Netflix, and others need an account for viewing. But his is no problem. Because I purchased it for my parents and they aren't interested in watching those channels at all. The Samsung Tv has 150 channels, starting from 1000. I viewed them one by one. All were good, mostly in English. I am impressed. üëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüòÅüòÅüòÅ
The Samsung Engineer helped us a lot, in other things too, like removing the set-top box stand from one room to fix in their room, and adjusting all wires, audio-visual pins and plugs, etc.. But this was not included in his service, so, we paid him for the extra service, though he was quite reluctant to accept the payment. You know, his service included only in installing Tv and downloading Smart App to start the function. But the other service wasn't included. He did it as kindness towards us, and we paid him as a token of gratitude. With God's Grace, all was done smoothly. Thanks to Lord for providing help in his form. And thanks to dealer and Samsung brand too for providing such service. üëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüôèüôèüôèüôèüôè üíêüíêüíêüíêüíê

 5 Stars - Excellent Product and Exceptional Customer Service!
Reviewed in India on 27 June 2024
Style Name: 65-LitreVerified Purchase
I recently purchased the Crompton Optimus Desert Air Cooler (65L) and I'm thoroughly impressed with both the product and the seller's service.

Product Review:
The cooler is well-built with high-quality plastic that feels durable. The honeycomb pads are highly effective, efficiently cooling the room without excessive noise. A standout feature is the ice chamber conveniently located at the top, which enhances the cooling effect.
Initially, I encountered a minor issue with water distribution to the honeycomb pads. However, this leads me to the most impressive part of my experience - the customer service.

Seller Service:
When I shared the issue during their follow-up for a review, the seller's reaction was swift and customer-focused. They immediately offered to replace the cooler, no questions asked. The next day, they sent someone to deliver a new unit and take back the faulty one.
This level of service went above and beyond my expectations. It was far more convenient than having to ship such a large item myself, which Amazon had initially suggested. The seller's proactive approach, quick resolution, and hassle-free replacement process were truly impressive.

I recommend both this cooler and this seller. The product is efficient and well-designed, and with this level of after-sales support, I couldn't be happier with my purchase. It's refreshing to see a company that stands behind their product and prioritizes customer satisfaction to this degree.

Plastic Material Discrepancy:
Notably, the ice chamber and cover are constructed from noticeably different plastics, both in texture and color. The chamber boasts a sturdier feel, while the cover feels flimsy and is of a distinctly different hue. This inconsistency in material quality is concerning, particularly for a product of this nature.

Cover Fitment Issues:
The cover's inability to close properly is a recurring annoyance, requiring undue force to secure it in place. Furthermore, its bent appearance near the corners suggests a lack of precision in the manufacturing process, leading to frustration during use.

Mosquito Net Blockage: Examination reveals that portions of the mosquito netting are completely sealed off, raising doubts about the effectiveness of ventilation. Such blockages could impede airflow to the honeycomb pad, potentially compromising the unit's cooling capabilities and placing undue strain on the fan mechanism.

Body Gaps:
Upon closer inspection, it becomes evident that there are multiple areas where the various components of the body fail to align seamlessly. These visible gaps suggest a lack of attention to detail during assembly, detracting from the product's overall aesthetic and functionality.

 Very good product crompton Desert air cooler
Reviewed in India on 8 April 2024
Style Name: 65-LitreVerified Purchase
Very good product crompton.
Air cooler size am not expect this much height .
It's very tall optimus 65 model.
It's suitable for big size hall ....
2 days am used this product ....
Cooling wise it's so wonderful am filling light hot water inside the chamber but output it's give cooling & breeze air .
First day approximately I filled 60-62 ltr water afternoon 1 to evening 8 o clock it's continuously running and comes under min level.

Second day filled 60 LTR water using at night time
9 pm to morning 5 am .
So average 8 hours it's running full tank capacity.

Noise wise quit good . Very pleasant .

First day full of honeycomb smell in hall .
But second day it's not in machine .
So smell so horrible at day 1 . So pls out of children from this cooler day 1.

Before operate & run the aircooler kindly check bottom chamber I identified two screw inside the water chamber.
I dont know how it's happened may be travelling time it may be happen .
So before check water chamber then you run it your cooler.

Note : Water issue area people & metro people
per day it's consump 60 ltr water so cost it around
25*3 water cane = 60 ruppes
60*30 days = 1800 rupees
+
Current bill consumption you add so total it around 2100 RS it's come monthly charge .
So my personal opinion
If you need aircooler for your home think & buy.
If water problem not in your area.
If water problem is there in your area kindly think and buy .

Thankyou

 PLASTIC FAN with ordinary plastic body and cheap workmanship
Reviewed in India on 15 March 2025
Style Name: 100-LitreVerified Purchase
The fan should be always metal. I had upgraded from Ozone 75 to this assuming blindly that the fan would be metal as was with the earlier. The fan is made of plastic and has only 3 wings. My old ozone 75 had 5 metal wings. The plastic was better, and over-all workmanship was good. The plastic here is flimsy and has lots of semi finished parts to it. There are a lot of gaps everywhere, the front grill is having so big gaps that a small kid can easily put his/her hands in as the louvers are way too flexible. Throw is ok, sound is reduced a bit. But thoroughly disappointed. Thought Crompton knew how to make a desert cooler. I guess I should have relied on my local, super trusterd Nagpur cooler vendor, Ram Coolers. Just hoping the motor should be good as I am thinking of changing the fan soon. Hope I can trust Crompton with atleast the fan motors.

 LG 335 L 3 Star - GL-T372JDS3 - Good Model
Reviewed in India on 25 December 2020
Colour: 2022 - Dazzle Steel | ConvertibleVerified Purchase
Exchange facility
Amazon exchange facility is much better than Flipkart. For the same old fridge (which was 17 yrs old but in good working condition), Flipkart refused to accept saying there are a few (minor) rust marks at bottom of door whereas Amazon accepted without any fuss.

Price
After researching on various 335ltr models, decided on this one due to features and price. Bought on 24-Oct-20 for a effective price of INR 27,500 after exchange, discounts and card cashback.

Delivery & Installation
The new fridge was delivered in good condition without any scratch or damage. Since I was without a fridge when the new one was delivered at 12pm (old taken away in exchange), the LG technician accepted my request to come the same day (at 4pm) and install the new one. I am thankful for this excellent gesture on his part.

Pros
The fridge area is spacious and feels bigger than the earlier LG 390 ltrs model which I was using. This is becos of the more shelves in this model. The pull out tray and the convertible box (above the veg bin) are very useful. The cooling at mid settings is good. The external look in very elegant. The build quality is very good and the fridge has sturdy look overall.

Cons
The vegetable / fruit storage bin at the bottom seems constricted in size and does not move freely. The inside area of freezer compartment also seems smaller as compared to the view from outside. The ice trays / storage occupy much space. No light in the freezer - not sure why LG does not install (even my 17 yr old did not have) inspite of its usefulness and every review mentioning this as a drawback. The user manual is very basic and does not explain the high / low feature in the convertible box / veg bin.

Overall
Though the cons look more, they are not so significant as compared to the good features. I am satisfied with this model and will recommend it.

 The wooooooooorsst company
Reviewed in India on 17 March 2025
Colour: Dazzle SteelVerified Purchase
I got damaged product and I placed for return, I‚Äôm not blaming LG company, from the LG, everything is fine, I‚Äôm talking about the delhivery company, it took nearly half a month to pickup a product, the wooooooorst agent and the wooooorst company, to delivery a refrigerator, only one person is it enough? But Amazon apps says two people will come to deliver. Before signing any contract, Amazon have to do background check up, Now a days every company doing background check up, for a small small postions. I think this company don‚Äôt even have an application where the agent can send a pic of the Customer building, so that it confirms he or she visited the customer location, they gave another option like contact was made but unable to reach customer, wooooow amazing, if he made a contact to the customer, this company app should witness the customer number, in this way should confirm, because of I‚Äôm staying in 2nd floor, they don‚Äôt want to deliver on the floor, then why Amazon accepting the order, if they are charging for the 2nd, 1st floor separately, we are ok to pay but this a wooooorst company where only one person delivering the refrigerator. What if the senior citizens staying on 2nd floor.
After reading this review people will think that , it‚Äôs not a company mistake, it‚Äôs mistake of agents.
Woooooooow
Keeping this I have asked few questions with agents he said, company only saying that not to deliver the product on the 2nd floor separately, deliver on ground floor, it doesn‚Äôt matter where they are staying.
From this I understood, company thinking about money not about growing in the future.
So, Amazon has open their eyes, think once again to do business with this wooooorst company.

Thank you.

NOTE: TV TABLE STAND IS NOT PROVIDED IN THE BOX. No Bluetooth support. Only wifi 2.4ghz is supported, no 5ghz wifi support. PICTURE & AUDIO quality is SUPERB. Supports dolby and hdr.
Buy this Only if u want reliability (samsung displays are very reliable and last long unlike cheap counterparts) , good picture and audio quality.

Bought the bezel less 2022 variant for 14,990 rupees.
Samsung is a reliable brand. Picture & quality is good. Although it's not a full hd 1080p display, at 32 inches its not apparent.

User interface is okay. Netflix app works smooth but prime video app is laggy. Tizen os is fine. So no google play store. Doesn't support chromecast, only supports Mira cast which is a different casting protocol.

Feature wise tizen os is bare minimum. But you can easily buy an android tv box to get google play functionality if u want to run android apps.

Brands like tcl, ifalconn, redmi offer more features because they run google tv\ android tv but their hardware is not reliable.

This samsung 32inches tv is great deal if u buy at 14k inr. Great picture clarity. Good sound quality. HDR works good. Samsung has great after sales customer service. So if u want good quality and reliable TV and don't care too much about having android tv os, go for this. It's a great product.

Product was intact, delivery was smooth. Open box inspection was done. It was delivered to our room where it was to be installed. It had all accessories except wall-top mount/table top, but that was provided by the Samsung , free of cost.
Display, Performance, Remote control all are functioning properly as till date. Picture quality, Sound, etc., are good too. Since it's a HD and Smart TV, the Samsung Engineer installed the Smart App and so, we can see YouTube, Samsung Tv and an other channel or two without making an account, but Netflix, and others need an account for viewing. But his is no problem. Because I purchased it for my parents and they aren't interested in watching those channels at all. The Samsung Tv has 150 channels, starting from 1000. I viewed them one by one. All were good, mostly in English. I am impressed. üëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüòÅüòÅüòÅ
The Samsung Engineer helped us a lot, in other things too, like removing the set-top box stand from one room to fix in their room, and adjusting all wires, audio-visual pins and plugs, etc.. But this was not included in his service, so, we paid him for the extra service, though he was quite reluctant to accept the payment. You know, his service included only in installing Tv and downloading Smart App to start the function. But the other service wasn't included. He did it as kindness towards us, and we paid him as a token of gratitude. With God's Grace, all was done smoothly. Thanks to Lord for providing help in his form. And thanks to dealer and Samsung brand too for providing such service. üëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüôèüôèüôèüôèüôè üíêüíêüíêüíêüíê

 Poor Seller Experience
Reviewed in India on 15 March 2025
Colour: UltramarineSize: 128 GBVerified Purchase
I am writing to formally complain about my recent purchase of an iPhone 16 from online on Amazon.
I received the item on the same day of purchase, but upon unboxing, I noticed that the iPhone came in a mismatched (muddled) box. When I powered it on, the phone was stuck on the ‚ÄúHello‚Äù screen, repeatedly displaying ‚ÄúHello‚Äù in multiple languages. It was completely unresponsive‚Äînone of the buttons, including the power and volume buttons, were functioning.

After approximately five hours, the battery finally drained, and the phone shut down. However, after restarting, the same issue persisted, with the device stuck on the ‚ÄúHello‚Äù screen again.

I contacted Amazon‚Äôs support team, who advised me to reach out to Apple Support. Apple Support suggested some troubleshooting steps, but none resolved the issue. Ultimately, they advised me to visit an Apple-authorized service center for a software reinstallation‚Äîon a brand-new phone.

I then had to travel 5 km to a Maple (Apple-authorized) service center, where they reinstalled the software. The process took about 45‚Äì50 minutes, finally making the phone functional.

I am extremely disappointed with this experience. After purchasing a costly device, I suffered an entire day of inconvenience due to the seller‚Äôs inefficiency or the company‚Äôs negligence in quality control. This is unacceptable, especially for a premium product.

Previously, I had purchased an iPhone 15 online without any issues, but this time, the experience was frustrating and disappointing. I strongly urge you to take action against this seller for supplying what appears to be old or improperly stored stock.

I request appropriate compensation for the inconvenience and mental stress caused. Additionally, I advise other customers to be cautious when purchasing from this seller.

I hope Amazon takes this matter seriously and ensures such incidents do not happen again.

They will give you same model but built quality and RAM and ROM will be more updated version. Also remember if you think online and offline products are same then you are wrong.

 Poor Seller Experience
Reviewed in India on 15 March 2025
Colour: UltramarineSize: 128 GBVerified Purchase
I am writing to formally complain about my recent purchase of an iPhone 16 from online on Amazon.
I received the item on the same day of purchase, but upon unboxing, I noticed that the iPhone came in a mismatched (muddled) box. When I powered it on, the phone was stuck on the ‚ÄúHello‚Äù screen, repeatedly displaying ‚ÄúHello‚Äù in multiple languages. It was completely unresponsive‚Äînone of the buttons, including the power and volume buttons, were functioning.

After approximately five hours, the battery finally drained, and the phone shut down. However, after restarting, the same issue persisted, with the device stuck on the ‚ÄúHello‚Äù screen again.

I contacted Amazon‚Äôs support team, who advised me to reach out to Apple Support. Apple Support suggested some troubleshooting steps, but none resolved the issue. Ultimately, they advised me to visit an Apple-authorized service center for a software reinstallation‚Äîon a brand-new phone.

I then had to travel 5 km to a Maple (Apple-authorized) service center, where they reinstalled the software. The process took about 45‚Äì50 minutes, finally making the phone functional.

I am extremely disappointed with this experience. After purchasing a costly device, I suffered an entire day of inconvenience due to the seller‚Äôs inefficiency or the company‚Äôs negligence in quality control. This is unacceptable, especially for a premium product.

Previously, I had purchased an iPhone 15 online without any issues, but this time, the experience was frustrating and disappointing. I strongly urge you to take action against this seller for supplying what appears to be old or improperly stored stock.

I request appropriate compensation for the inconvenience and mental stress caused. Additionally, I advise other customers to be cautious when purchasing from this seller.

I hope Amazon takes this matter seriously and ensures such incidents do not happen again.

I‚Äôve been using the Noise Pro 6 Max Smart Watch for a few weeks now, and it‚Äôs been a fantastic experience! The 1.96‚Äù AMOLED display is crisp and vibrant, making everything easy to read, even in bright sunlight.

The AI companion is surprisingly responsive, and I love the endless AI watch faces that let me customize the look to match my mood. The built-in GPS is accurate, which makes it perfect for outdoor workouts, and the 5 ATM water resistance gives me peace of mind during workouts and rainy days.

The EN2 Processor ensures smooth performance, with no lag when switching between apps. Plus, it works seamlessly with both iOS and Android devices, which is a huge plus.

Overall, this smartwatch offers great value for money with its advanced features and sleek design. Highly recommended! ‚åöüíØ

Product is very good but I will suggest if you are paying 13000 and purchasing in online mode then pls pay 2000 more and go offline and buy from shop. They will give you same model but built quality and RAM and ROM will be more updated version. Also remember if you think online and offline products are same then you are wrong.

Size: 32 inches | HD Smart Bezel-less DesignVerified Purchase
NOTE: TV TABLE STAND IS NOT PROVIDED IN THE BOX. No Bluetooth support. Only wifi 2.4ghz is supported, no 5ghz wifi support. PICTURE & AUDIO quality is SUPERB. Supports dolby and hdr.
Buy this Only if u want reliability (samsung displays are very reliable and last long unlike cheap counterparts) , good picture and audio quality.

Bought the bezel less 2022 variant for 14,990 rupees.
Samsung is a reliable brand. Picture & quality is good. Although it's not a full hd 1080p display, at 32 inches its not apparent.

User interface is okay. Netflix app works smooth but prime video app is laggy. Tizen os is fine. So no google play store. Doesn't support chromecast, only supports Mira cast which is a different casting protocol.

Feature wise tizen os is bare minimum. But you can easily buy an android tv box to get google play functionality if u want to run android apps.

Brands like tcl, ifalconn, redmi offer more features because they run google tv\ android tv but their hardware is not reliable.

This samsung 32inches tv is great deal if u buy at 14k inr. Great picture clarity. Good sound quality. HDR works good. Samsung has great after sales customer service. So if u want good quality and reliable TV and don't care too much about having android tv os, go for this. It's a great product.

Product was intact, delivery was smooth. Open box inspection was done. It was delivered to our room where it was to be installed. It had all accessories except wall-top mount/table top, but that was provided by the Samsung , free of cost.
Display, Performance, Remote control all are functioning properly as till date. Picture quality, Sound, etc., are good too. Since it's a HD and Smart TV, the Samsung Engineer installed the Smart App and so, we can see YouTube, Samsung Tv and an other channel or two without making an account, but Netflix, and others need an account for viewing. But his is no problem. Because I purchased it for my parents and they aren't interested in watching those channels at all. The Samsung Tv has 150 channels, starting from 1000. I viewed them one by one. All were good, mostly in English. I am impressed. üëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüòÅüòÅüòÅ
The Samsung Engineer helped us a lot, in other things too, like removing the set-top box stand from one room to fix in their room, and adjusting all wires, audio-visual pins and plugs, etc.. But this was not included in his service, so, we paid him for the extra service, though he was quite reluctant to accept the payment. You know, his service included only in installing Tv and downloading Smart App to start the function. But the other service wasn't included. He did it as kindness towards us, and we paid him as a token of gratitude. With God's Grace, all was done smoothly. Thanks to Lord for providing help in his form. And thanks to dealer and Samsung brand too for providing such service. üëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüôèüôèüôèüôèüôè üíêüíêüíêüíêüíê

 Poor Seller Experience
Reviewed in India on 15 March 2025
Colour: UltramarineSize: 128 GBVerified Purchase
I am writing to formally complain about my recent purchase of an iPhone 16 from online on Amazon.
I received the item on the same day of purchase, but upon unboxing, I noticed that the iPhone came in a mismatched (muddled) box. When I powered it on, the phone was stuck on the ‚ÄúHello‚Äù screen, repeatedly displaying ‚ÄúHello‚Äù in multiple languages. It was completely unresponsive‚Äînone of the buttons, including the power and volume buttons, were functioning.

After approximately five hours, the battery finally drained, and the phone shut down. However, after restarting, the same issue persisted, with the device stuck on the ‚ÄúHello‚Äù screen again.

I contacted Amazon‚Äôs support team, who advised me to reach out to Apple Support. Apple Support suggested some troubleshooting steps, but none resolved the issue. Ultimately, they advised me to visit an Apple-authorized service center for a software reinstallation‚Äîon a brand-new phone.

I then had to travel 5 km to a Maple (Apple-authorized) service center, where they reinstalled the software. The process took about 45‚Äì50 minutes, finally making the phone functional.

I am extremely disappointed with this experience. After purchasing a costly device, I suffered an entire day of inconvenience due to the seller‚Äôs inefficiency or the company‚Äôs negligence in quality control. This is unacceptable, especially for a premium product.

Previously, I had purchased an iPhone 15 online without any issues, but this time, the experience was frustrating and disappointing. I strongly urge you to take action against this seller for supplying what appears to be old or improperly stored stock.

I request appropriate compensation for the inconvenience and mental stress caused. Additionally, I advise other customers to be cautious when purchasing from this seller.

I hope Amazon takes this matter seriously and ensures such incidents do not happen again.

Previously, I had purchased an iPhone 15 online without any issues, but this time, the experience was frustrating and disappointing. I strongly urge you to take action against this seller for supplying what appears to be old or improperly stored stock.

I request appropriate compensation for the inconvenience and mental stress caused. Additionally, I advise other customers to be cautious when purchasing from this seller.

I hope Amazon takes this matter seriously and ensures such incidents do not happen again.

Colour: Jet BlackVerified Purchase
I‚Äôve been using the Noise Pro 6 Max Smart Watch for a few weeks now, and it‚Äôs been a fantastic experience! The 1.96‚Äù AMOLED display is crisp and vibrant, making everything easy to read, even in bright sunlight. The stainless steel build gives it a premium look and feel‚Äîdefinitely a step up from plastic models.

The AI companion is surprisingly responsive, and I love the endless AI watch faces that let me customize the look to match my mood. The built-in GPS is accurate, which makes it perfect for outdoor workouts, and the 5 ATM water resistance gives me peace of mind during workouts and rainy days.

The EN2 Processor ensures smooth performance, with no lag when switching between apps. Plus, it works seamlessly with both iOS and Android devices, which is a huge plus.

Overall, this smartwatch offers great value for money with its advanced features and sleek design. Highly recommended! ‚åöüíØ

Crompton Optimus 100 Litres Desert Air Cooler for home,"	Prabal
5.0 out of 5 stars
 5 Stars - Excellent Product and Exceptional Customer Service!
Reviewed in India on 27 June 2024
Style Name: 65-LitreVerified Purchase
I recently purchased the Crompton Optimus Desert Air Cooler (65L) and I'm thoroughly impressed with both the product and the seller's service.

Product Review:
The cooler is well-built with high-quality plastic that feels durable. The honeycomb pads are highly effective, efficiently cooling the room without excessive noise. A standout feature is the ice chamber conveniently located at the top, which enhances the cooling effect.
Initially, I encountered a minor issue with water distribution to the honeycomb pads. However, this leads me to the most impressive part of my experience - the customer service.

Seller Service:
When I shared the issue during their follow-up for a review, the seller's reaction was swift and customer-focused. They immediately offered to replace the cooler, no questions asked. The next day, they sent someone to deliver a new unit and take back the faulty one.
This level of service went above and beyond my expectations. It was far more convenient than having to ship such a large item myself, which Amazon had initially suggested. The seller's proactive approach, quick resolution, and hassle-free replacement process were truly impressive.

I recommend both this cooler and this seller. The product is efficient and well-designed, and with this level of after-sales support, I couldn't be happier with my purchase. It's refreshing to see a company that stands behind their product and prioritizes customer satisfaction to this degree.

 Very disappointed by Amzone
Reviewed in India on 9 March 2025
Style Name: 100-LitreVerified Purchase
Plastic Material Discrepancy:
Notably, the ice chamber and cover are constructed from noticeably different plastics, both in texture and color. The chamber boasts a sturdier feel, while the cover feels flimsy and is of a distinctly different hue. This inconsistency in material quality is concerning, particularly for a product of this nature.

Cover Fitment Issues:
The cover's inability to close properly is a recurring annoyance, requiring undue force to secure it in place. Furthermore, its bent appearance near the corners suggests a lack of precision in the manufacturing process, leading to frustration during use.

Mosquito Net Blockage: Examination reveals that portions of the mosquito netting are completely sealed off, raising doubts about the effectiveness of ventilation. Such blockages could impede airflow to the honeycomb pad, potentially compromising the unit's cooling capabilities and placing undue strain on the fan mechanism.

Body Gaps:
Upon closer inspection, it becomes evident that there are multiple areas where the various components of the body fail to align seamlessly. These visible gaps suggest a lack of attention to detail during assembly, detracting from the product's overall aesthetic and functionality.

 Very good product crompton Desert air cooler
Reviewed in India on 8 April 2024
Style Name: 65-LitreVerified Purchase
Very good product crompton.
Air cooler size am not expect this much height .
It's very tall optimus 65 model.
It's suitable for big size hall ....
2 days am used this product ....
Cooling wise it's so wonderful am filling light hot water inside the chamber but output it's give cooling & breeze air .
First day approximately I filled 60-62 ltr water afternoon 1 to evening 8 o clock it's continuously running and comes under min level.

Second day filled 60 LTR water using at night time
9 pm to morning 5 am .
So average 8 hours it's running full tank capacity.

Noise wise quit good . Very pleasant .

First day full of honeycomb smell in hall .
But second day it's not in machine .
So smell so horrible at day 1 . So pls out of children from this cooler day 1.

Before operate & run the aircooler kindly check bottom chamber I identified two screw inside the water chamber.
I dont know how it's happened may be travelling time it may be happen .
So before check water chamber then you run it your cooler.

Note : Water issue area people & metro people
per day it's consump 60 ltr water so cost it around
25*3 water cane = 60 ruppes
60*30 days = 1800 rupees
+
Current bill consumption you add so total it around 2100 RS it's come monthly charge .
So my personal opinion
If you need aircooler for your home think & buy.
If water problem not in your area.
If water problem is there in your area kindly think and buy .

Thankyou

 PLASTIC FAN with ordinary plastic body and cheap workmanship
Reviewed in India on 15 March 2025
Style Name: 100-LitreVerified Purchase
The fan should be always metal. I had upgraded from Ozone 75 to this assuming blindly that the fan would be metal as was with the earlier. The fan is made of plastic and has only 3 wings. My old ozone 75 had 5 metal wings. The plastic was better, and over-all workmanship was good. The plastic here is flimsy and has lots of semi finished parts to it. There are a lot of gaps everywhere, the front grill is having so big gaps that a small kid can easily put his/her hands in as the louvers are way too flexible. Throw is ok, sound is reduced a bit. But thoroughly disappointed. Thought Crompton knew how to make a desert cooler. I guess I should have relied on my local, super trusterd Nagpur cooler vendor, Ram Coolers. Just hoping the motor should be good as I am thinking of changing the fan soon. Hope I can trust Crompton with atleast the fan motors.

NOTE: TV TABLE STAND IS NOT PROVIDED IN THE BOX. No Bluetooth support. Only wifi 2.4ghz is supported, no 5ghz wifi support. PICTURE & AUDIO quality is SUPERB. Supports dolby and hdr.
Buy this Only if u want reliability (samsung displays are very reliable and last long unlike cheap counterparts) , good picture and audio quality.

Bought the bezel less 2022 variant for 14,990 rupees.
Samsung is a reliable brand. Picture & quality is good. Although it's not a full hd 1080p display, at 32 inches its not apparent.

User interface is okay. Netflix app works smooth but prime video app is laggy. Tizen os is fine. So no google play store. Doesn't support chromecast, only supports Mira cast which is a different casting protocol.

Feature wise tizen os is bare minimum. But you can easily buy an android tv box to get google play functionality if u want to run android apps.

Brands like tcl, ifalconn, redmi offer more features because they run google tv\ android tv but their hardware is not reliable.

This samsung 32inches tv is great deal if u buy at 14k inr. Great picture clarity. Good sound quality. HDR works good. Samsung has great after sales customer service. So if u want good quality and reliable TV and don't care too much about having android tv os, go for this. It's a great product.

I am writing to formally complain about my recent purchase of an iPhone 16 from online on Amazon.
I received the item on the same day of purchase, but upon unboxing, I noticed that the iPhone came in a mismatched (muddled) box. When I powered it on, the phone was stuck on the ‚ÄúHello‚Äù screen, repeatedly displaying ‚ÄúHello‚Äù in multiple languages. It was completely unresponsive‚Äînone of the buttons, including the power and volume buttons, were functioning.

After approximately five hours, the battery finally drained, and the phone shut down. However, after restarting, the same issue persisted, with the device stuck on the ‚ÄúHello‚Äù screen again.

I contacted Amazon‚Äôs support team, who advised me to reach out to Apple Support. Apple Support suggested some troubleshooting steps, but none resolved the issue. Ultimately, they advised me to visit an Apple-authorized service center for a software reinstallation‚Äîon a brand-new phone.

I then had to travel 5 km to a Maple (Apple-authorized) service center, where they reinstalled the software. The process took about 45‚Äì50 minutes, finally making the phone functional.

I am extremely disappointed with this experience. After purchasing a costly device, I suffered an entire day of inconvenience due to the seller‚Äôs inefficiency or the company‚Äôs negligence in quality control. This is unacceptable, especially for a premium product.

Previously, I had purchased an iPhone 15 online without any issues, but this time, the experience was frustrating and disappointing. I strongly urge you to take action against this seller for supplying what appears to be old or improperly stored stock.

I request appropriate compensation for the inconvenience and mental stress caused. Additionally, I advise other customers to be cautious when purchasing from this seller.

I hope Amazon takes this matter seriously and ensures such incidents do not happen again.

Product was intact, delivery was smooth. Open box inspection was done. It was delivered to our room where it was to be installed. It had all accessories except wall-top mount/table top, but that was provided by the Samsung , free of cost.
Display, Performance, Remote control all are functioning properly as till date. Picture quality, Sound, etc., are good too. Since it's a HD and Smart TV, the Samsung Engineer installed the Smart App and so, we can see YouTube, Samsung Tv and an other channel or two without making an account, but Netflix, and others need an account for viewing. But his is no problem. Because I purchased it for my parents and they aren't interested in watching those channels at all. The Samsung Tv has 150 channels, starting from 1000. I viewed them one by one. All were good, mostly in English. I am impressed. üëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüòÅüòÅüòÅ
The Samsung Engineer helped us a lot, in other things too, like removing the set-top box stand from one room to fix in their room, and adjusting all wires, audio-visual pins and plugs, etc.. But this was not included in his service, so, we paid him for the extra service, though he was quite reluctant to accept the payment. You know, his service included only in installing Tv and downloading Smart App to start the function. But the other service wasn't included. He did it as kindness towards us, and we paid him as a token of gratitude. With God's Grace, all was done smoothly. Thanks to Lord for providing help in his form. And thanks to dealer and Samsung brand too for providing such service. üëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüôèüôèüôèüôèüôè üíêüíêüíêüíêüíê

Product was intact, delivery was smooth. Open box inspection was done. It was delivered to our room where it was to be installed. It had all accessories except wall-top mount/table top, but that was provided by the Samsung , free of cost.
Display, Performance, Remote control all are functioning properly as till date. Picture quality, Sound, etc., are good too. Since it's a HD and Smart TV, the Samsung Engineer installed the Smart App and so, we can see YouTube, Samsung Tv and an other channel or two without making an account, but Netflix, and others need an account for viewing. But his is no problem. Because I purchased it for my parents and they aren't interested in watching those channels at all. The Samsung Tv has 150 channels, starting from 1000. I viewed them one by one. All were good, mostly in English. I am impressed. üëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüòÅüòÅüòÅ
The Samsung Engineer helped us a lot, in other things too, like removing the set-top box stand from one room to fix in their room, and adjusting all wires, audio-visual pins and plugs, etc.. But this was not included in his service, so, we paid him for the extra service, though he was quite reluctant to accept the payment. You know, his service included only in installing Tv and downloading Smart App to start the function. But the other service wasn't included. He did it as kindness towards us, and we paid him as a token of gratitude. With God's Grace, all was done smoothly. Thanks to Lord for providing help in his form. And thanks to dealer and Samsung brand too for providing such service. üëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüôèüôèüôèüôèüôè üíêüíêüíêüíêüíê

Product is very good but I will suggest if you are paying 13000 and purchasing in online mode then pls pay 2000 more and go offline and buy from shop. They will give you same model but built quality and RAM and ROM will be more updated version. Also remember if you think online and offline products are same then you are wrong.

NOTE: TV TABLE STAND IS NOT PROVIDED IN THE BOX. No Bluetooth support. Only wifi 2.4ghz is supported, no 5ghz wifi support. PICTURE & AUDIO quality is SUPERB. Supports dolby and hdr.
Buy this Only if u want reliability (samsung displays are very reliable and last long unlike cheap counterparts) , good picture and audio quality.

Bought the bezel less 2022 variant for 14,990 rupees.
Samsung is a reliable brand. Picture & quality is good. Although it's not a full hd 1080p display, at 32 inches its not apparent.

User interface is okay. Netflix app works smooth but prime video app is laggy. Tizen os is fine. So no google play store. Doesn't support chromecast, only supports Mira cast which is a different casting protocol.

Feature wise tizen os is bare minimum. But you can easily buy an android tv box to get google play functionality if u want to run android apps.

Brands like tcl, ifalconn, redmi offer more features because they run google tv\ android tv but their hardware is not reliable.

This samsung 32inches tv is great deal if u buy at 14k inr. Great picture clarity. Good sound quality. HDR works good. Samsung has great after sales customer service. So if u want good quality and reliable TV and don't care too much about having android tv os, go for this. It's a great product.

 Poor Seller Experience
Reviewed in India on 15 March 2025
Colour: UltramarineSize: 128 GBVerified Purchase
I am writing to formally complain about my recent purchase of an iPhone 16 from online on Amazon.
I received the item on the same day of purchase, but upon unboxing, I noticed that the iPhone came in a mismatched (muddled) box. When I powered it on, the phone was stuck on the ‚ÄúHello‚Äù screen, repeatedly displaying ‚ÄúHello‚Äù in multiple languages. It was completely unresponsive‚Äînone of the buttons, including the power and volume buttons, were functioning.

After approximately five hours, the battery finally drained, and the phone shut down. However, after restarting, the same issue persisted, with the device stuck on the ‚ÄúHello‚Äù screen again.

I contacted Amazon‚Äôs support team, who advised me to reach out to Apple Support. Apple Support suggested some troubleshooting steps, but none resolved the issue. Ultimately, they advised me to visit an Apple-authorized service center for a software reinstallation‚Äîon a brand-new phone.

I then had to travel 5 km to a Maple (Apple-authorized) service center, where they reinstalled the software. The process took about 45‚Äì50 minutes, finally making the phone functional.

I am extremely disappointed with this experience. After purchasing a costly device, I suffered an entire day of inconvenience due to the seller‚Äôs inefficiency or the company‚Äôs negligence in quality control. This is unacceptable, especially for a premium product.

Previously, I had purchased an iPhone 15 online without any issues, but this time, the experience was frustrating and disappointing. I strongly urge you to take action against this seller for supplying what appears to be old or improperly stored stock.

I request appropriate compensation for the inconvenience and mental stress caused. Additionally, I advise other customers to be cautious when purchasing from this seller.

I hope Amazon takes this matter seriously and ensures such incidents do not happen again.

 Poor Seller Experience
Reviewed in India on 15 March 2025
Colour: UltramarineSize: 128 GBVerified Purchase
I am writing to formally complain about my recent purchase of an iPhone 16 from online on Amazon.
I received the item on the same day of purchase, but upon unboxing, I noticed that the iPhone came in a mismatched (muddled) box. When I powered it on, the phone was stuck on the ‚ÄúHello‚Äù screen, repeatedly displaying ‚ÄúHello‚Äù in multiple languages. It was completely unresponsive‚Äînone of the buttons, including the power and volume buttons, were functioning.

After approximately five hours, the battery finally drained, and the phone shut down. However, after restarting, the same issue persisted, with the device stuck on the ‚ÄúHello‚Äù screen again.

I contacted Amazon‚Äôs support team, who advised me to reach out to Apple Support. Apple Support suggested some troubleshooting steps, but none resolved the issue. Ultimately, they advised me to visit an Apple-authorized service center for a software reinstallation‚Äîon a brand-new phone.

I then had to travel 5 km to a Maple (Apple-authorized) service center, where they reinstalled the software. The process took about 45‚Äì50 minutes, finally making the phone functional.

I am extremely disappointed with this experience. After purchasing a costly device, I suffered an entire day of inconvenience due to the seller‚Äôs inefficiency or the company‚Äôs negligence in quality control. This is unacceptable, especially for a premium product.

Previously, I had purchased an iPhone 15 online without any issues, but this time, the experience was frustrating and disappointing. I strongly urge you to take action against this seller for supplying what appears to be old or improperly stored stock.

I request appropriate compensation for the inconvenience and mental stress caused. Additionally, I advise other customers to be cautious when purchasing from this seller.

I hope Amazon takes this matter seriously and ensures such incidents do not happen again.

I‚Äôve been using the Noise Pro 6 Max Smart Watch for a few weeks now, and it‚Äôs been a fantastic experience! The 1.96‚Äù AMOLED display is crisp and vibrant, making everything easy to read, even in bright sunlight. The stainless steel build gives it a premium look and feel‚Äîdefinitely a step up from plastic models.

The AI companion is surprisingly responsive, and I love the endless AI watch faces that let me customize the look to match my mood. The built-in GPS is accurate, which makes it perfect for outdoor workouts, and the 5 ATM water resistance gives me peace of mind during workouts and rainy days.

The EN2 Processor ensures smooth performance, with no lag when switching between apps. Plus, it works seamlessly with both iOS and Android devices, which is a huge plus.

Overall, this smartwatch offers great value for money with its advanced features and sleek design. Highly recommended! ‚åöüíØ

Crompton Optimus 100 Litres Desert Air Cooler for home,"	Prabal

 5 Stars - Excellent Product and Exceptional Customer Service!
Reviewed in India on 27 June 2024
Style Name: 65-LitreVerified Purchase
I recently purchased the Crompton Optimus Desert Air Cooler (65L) and I'm thoroughly impressed with both the product and the seller's service.

Product Review:
The cooler is well-built with high-quality plastic that feels durable. The honeycomb pads are highly effective, efficiently cooling the room without excessive noise. A standout feature is the ice chamber conveniently located at the top, which enhances the cooling effect.
Initially, I encountered a minor issue with water distribution to the honeycomb pads. However, this leads me to the most impressive part of my experience - the customer service.

Seller Service:
When I shared the issue during their follow-up for a review, the seller's reaction was swift and customer-focused. They immediately offered to replace the cooler, no questions asked. The next day, they sent someone to deliver a new unit and take back the faulty one.
This level of service went above and beyond my expectations. It was far more convenient than having to ship such a large item myself, which Amazon had initially suggested. The seller's proactive approach, quick resolution, and hassle-free replacement process were truly impressive.

I recommend both this cooler and this seller. The product is efficient and well-designed, and with this level of after-sales support, I couldn't be happier with my purchase. It's refreshing to see a company that stands behind their product and prioritizes customer satisfaction to this degree.

Plastic Material Discrepancy:
Notably, the ice chamber and cover are constructed from noticeably different plastics, both in texture and color. The chamber boasts a sturdier feel, while the cover feels flimsy and is of a distinctly different hue. This inconsistency in material quality is concerning, particularly for a product of this nature.

Cover Fitment Issues:
The cover's inability to close properly is a recurring annoyance, requiring undue force to secure it in place. Furthermore, its bent appearance near the corners suggests a lack of precision in the manufacturing process, leading to frustration during use.

Mosquito Net Blockage: Examination reveals that portions of the mosquito netting are completely sealed off, raising doubts about the effectiveness of ventilation. Such blockages could impede airflow to the honeycomb pad, potentially compromising the unit's cooling capabilities and placing undue strain on the fan mechanism.

Body Gaps:
Upon closer inspection, it becomes evident that there are multiple areas where the various components of the body fail to align seamlessly. These visible gaps suggest a lack of attention to detail during assembly, detracting from the product's overall aesthetic and functionality.

 Very good product crompton Desert air cooler
Reviewed in India on 8 April 2024
Style Name: 65-LitreVerified Purchase
Very good product crompton.
Air cooler size am not expect this much height .
It's very tall optimus 65 model.
It's suitable for big size hall ....
2 days am used this product ....
Cooling wise it's so wonderful am filling light hot water inside the chamber but output it's give cooling & breeze air .
First day approximately I filled 60-62 ltr water afternoon 1 to evening 8 o clock it's continuously running and comes under min level.

Second day filled 60 LTR water using at night time
9 pm to morning 5 am .
So average 8 hours it's running full tank capacity.

Noise wise quit good . Very pleasant .

First day full of honeycomb smell in hall .
But second day it's not in machine .
So smell so horrible at day 1 . So pls out of children from this cooler day 1.

Before operate & run the aircooler kindly check bottom chamber I identified two screw inside the water chamber.
I dont know how it's happened may be travelling time it may be happen .
So before check water chamber then you run it your cooler.

Note : Water issue area people & metro people
per day it's consump 60 ltr water so cost it around
25*3 water cane = 60 ruppes
60*30 days = 1800 rupees
+
Current bill consumption you add so total it around 2100 RS it's come monthly charge .
So my personal opinion
If you need aircooler for your home think & buy.
If water problem not in your area.
If water problem is there in your area kindly think and buy .

Thankyou

 PLASTIC FAN with ordinary plastic body and cheap workmanship
Reviewed in India on 15 March 2025
Style Name: 100-LitreVerified Purchase
The fan should be always metal. I had upgraded from Ozone 75 to this assuming blindly that the fan would be metal as was with the earlier. The fan is made of plastic and has only 3 wings. My old ozone 75 had 5 metal wings. The plastic was better, and over-all workmanship was good. The plastic here is flimsy and has lots of semi finished parts to it. There are a lot of gaps everywhere, the front grill is having so big gaps that a small kid can easily put his/her hands in as the louvers are way too flexible. Throw is ok, sound is reduced a bit. But thoroughly disappointed. Thought Crompton knew how to make a desert cooler. I guess I should have relied on my local, super trusterd Nagpur cooler vendor, Ram Coolers. Just hoping the motor should be good as I am thinking of changing the fan soon. Hope I can trust Crompton with atleast the fan motors.

Colour: 2022 - Dazzle Steel | ConvertibleVerified Purchase
Exchange facility
Amazon exchange facility is much better than Flipkart. For the same old fridge (which was 17 yrs old but in good working condition), Flipkart refused to accept saying there are a few (minor) rust marks at bottom of door whereas Amazon accepted without any fuss.

Price
After researching on various 335ltr models, decided on this one due to features and price. Bought on 24-Oct-20 for a effective price of INR 27,500 after exchange, discounts and card cashback.

Delivery & Installation
The new fridge was delivered in good condition without any scratch or damage. Since I was without a fridge when the new one was delivered at 12pm (old taken away in exchange), the LG technician accepted my request to come the same day (at 4pm) and install the new one. I am thankful for this excellent gesture on his part.

Pros
The fridge area is spacious and feels bigger than the earlier LG 390 ltrs model which I was using. This is becos of the more shelves in this model. The pull out tray and the convertible box (above the veg bin) are very useful. The cooling at mid settings is good. The external look in very elegant. The build quality is very good and the fridge has sturdy look overall.

Cons
The vegetable / fruit storage bin at the bottom seems constricted in size and does not move freely. The inside area of freezer compartment also seems smaller as compared to the view from outside. The ice trays / storage occupy much space. No light in the freezer - not sure why LG does not install (even my 17 yr old did not have) inspite of its usefulness and every review mentioning this as a drawback. The user manual is very basic and does not explain the high / low feature in the convertible box / veg bin.

Overall
Though the cons look more, they are not so significant as compared to the good features. I am satisfied with this model and will recommend it.

I got damaged product and I placed for return, I‚Äôm not blaming LG company, from the LG, everything is fine, I‚Äôm talking about the delhivery company, it took nearly half a month to pickup a product, the wooooooorst agent and the wooooorst company, to delivery a refrigerator, only one person is it enough? But Amazon apps says two people will come to deliver. Before signing any contract, Amazon have to do background check up, Now a days every company doing background check up, for a small small postions. I think this company don‚Äôt even have an application where the agent can send a pic of the Customer building, so that it confirms he or she visited the customer location, they gave another option like contact was made but unable to reach customer, wooooow amazing, if he made a contact to the customer, this company app should witness the customer number, in this way should confirm, because of I‚Äôm staying in 2nd floor, they don‚Äôt want to deliver on the floor, then why Amazon accepting the order, if they are charging for the 2nd, 1st floor separately, we are ok to pay but this a wooooorst company where only one person delivering the refrigerator. What if the senior citizens staying on 2nd floor.
After reading this review people will think that , it‚Äôs not a company mistake, it‚Äôs mistake of agents.
Woooooooow
Keeping this I have asked few questions with agents he said, company only saying that not to deliver the product on the 2nd floor separately, deliver on ground floor, it doesn‚Äôt matter where they are staying.
From this I understood, company thinking about money not about growing in the future.
So, Amazon has open their eyes, think once again to do business with this wooooorst company.

Thank you.

NOTE: TV TABLE STAND IS NOT PROVIDED IN THE BOX. No Bluetooth support. Only wifi 2.4ghz is supported, no 5ghz wifi support. PICTURE & AUDIO quality is SUPERB. Supports dolby and hdr.
Buy this Only if u want reliability (samsung displays are very reliable and last long unlike cheap counterparts) , good picture and audio quality.

Bought the bezel less 2022 variant for 14,990 rupees.
Samsung is a reliable brand. Picture & quality is good. Although it's not a full hd 1080p display, at 32 inches its not apparent.

User interface is okay. Netflix app works smooth but prime video app is laggy. Tizen os is fine. So no google play store. Doesn't support chromecast, only supports Mira cast which is a different casting protocol.

Feature wise tizen os is bare minimum. But you can easily buy an android tv box to get google play functionality if u want to run android apps.

Brands like tcl, ifalconn, redmi offer more features because they run google tv\ android tv but their hardware is not reliable.

This samsung 32inches tv is great deal if u buy at 14k inr. Great picture clarity. Good sound quality. HDR works good. Samsung has great after sales customer service. So if u want good quality and reliable TV and don't care too much about having android tv os, go for this. It's a great product.

Product was intact, delivery was smooth. Open box inspection was done. It was delivered to our room where it was to be installed. It had all accessories except wall-top mount/table top, but that was provided by the Samsung , free of cost.
Display, Performance, Remote control all are functioning properly as till date. Picture quality, Sound, etc., are good too. Since it's a HD and Smart TV, the Samsung Engineer installed the Smart App and so, we can see YouTube, Samsung Tv and an other channel or two without making an account, but Netflix, and others need an account for viewing. But his is no problem. Because I purchased it for my parents and they aren't interested in watching those channels at all. The Samsung Tv has 150 channels, starting from 1000. I viewed them one by one. All were good, mostly in English. I am impressed. üëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüòÅüòÅüòÅ
The Samsung Engineer helped us a lot, in other things too, like removing the set-top box stand from one room to fix in their room, and adjusting all wires, audio-visual pins and plugs, etc.. But this was not included in his service, so, we paid him for the extra service, though he was quite reluctant to accept the payment. You know, his service included only in installing Tv and downloading Smart App to start the function. But the other service wasn't included. He did it as kindness towards us, and we paid him as a token of gratitude. With God's Grace, all was done smoothly. Thanks to Lord for providing help in his form. And thanks to dealer and Samsung brand too for providing such service. üëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüôèüôèüôèüôèüôè üíêüíêüíêüíêüíê

NOTE: TV TABLE STAND IS NOT PROVIDED IN THE BOX. No Bluetooth support. Only wifi 2.4ghz is supported, no 5ghz wifi support. PICTURE & AUDIO quality is SUPERB. Supports dolby and hdr.
Buy this Only if u want reliability (samsung displays are very reliable and last long unlike cheap counterparts) , good picture and audio quality.

Bought the bezel less 2022 variant for 14,990 rupees.
Samsung is a reliable brand. Picture & quality is good. Although it's not a full hd 1080p display, at 32 inches its not apparent.

User interface is okay. Netflix app works smooth but prime video app is laggy. Tizen os is fine. So no google play store. Doesn't support chromecast, only supports Mira cast which is a different casting protocol.

Feature wise tizen os is bare minimum. But you can easily buy an android tv box to get google play functionality if u want to run android apps.

Brands like tcl, ifalconn, redmi offer more features because they run google tv\ android tv but their hardware is not reliable.

This samsung 32inches tv is great deal if u buy at 14k inr. Great picture clarity. Good sound quality. HDR works good. Samsung has great after sales customer service. So if u want good quality and reliable TV and don't care too much about having android tv os, go for this. It's a great product.

Product was intact, delivery was smooth. Open box inspection was done. It was delivered to our room where it was to be installed. It had all accessories except wall-top mount/table top, but that was provided by the Samsung , free of cost.
Display, Performance, Remote control all are functioning properly as till date. Picture quality, Sound, etc., are good too. Since it's a HD and Smart TV, the Samsung Engineer installed the Smart App and so, we can see YouTube, Samsung Tv and an other channel or two without making an account, but Netflix, and others need an account for viewing. But his is no problem. Because I purchased it for my parents and they aren't interested in watching those channels at all. The Samsung Tv has 150 channels, starting from 1000. I viewed them one by one. All were good, mostly in English. I am impressed. üëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüòÅüòÅüòÅ
The Samsung Engineer helped us a lot, in other things too, like removing the set-top box stand from one room to fix in their room, and adjusting all wires, audio-visual pins and plugs, etc.. But this was not included in his service, so, we paid him for the extra service, though he was quite reluctant to accept the payment. You know, his service included only in installing Tv and downloading Smart App to start the function. But the other service wasn't included. He did it as kindness towards us, and we paid him as a token of gratitude. With God's Grace, all was done smoothly. Thanks to Lord for providing help in his form. And thanks to dealer and Samsung brand too for providing such service. üëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüôèüôèüôèüôèüôè üíêüíêüíêüíêüíê

 Poor Seller Experience
Reviewed in India on 15 March 2025
Colour: UltramarineSize: 128 GBVerified Purchase
I am writing to formally complain about my recent purchase of an iPhone 16 from online on Amazon.
I received the item on the same day of purchase, but upon unboxing, I noticed that the iPhone came in a mismatched (muddled) box. When I powered it on, the phone was stuck on the ‚ÄúHello‚Äù screen, repeatedly displaying ‚ÄúHello‚Äù in multiple languages. It was completely unresponsive‚Äînone of the buttons, including the power and volume buttons, were functioning.

After approximately five hours, the battery finally drained, and the phone shut down. However, after restarting, the same issue persisted, with the device stuck on the ‚ÄúHello‚Äù screen again.

I contacted Amazon‚Äôs support team, who advised me to reach out to Apple Support. Apple Support suggested some troubleshooting steps, but none resolved the issue. Ultimately, they advised me to visit an Apple-authorized service center for a software reinstallation‚Äîon a brand-new phone.

I then had to travel 5 km to a Maple (Apple-authorized) service center, where they reinstalled the software. The process took about 45‚Äì50 minutes, finally making the phone functional.

I am extremely disappointed with this experience. After purchasing a costly device, I suffered an entire day of inconvenience due to the seller‚Äôs inefficiency or the company‚Äôs negligence in quality control. This is unacceptable, especially for a premium product.

Previously, I had purchased an iPhone 15 online without any issues, but this time, the experience was frustrating and disappointing. I strongly urge you to take action against this seller for supplying what appears to be old or improperly stored stock.

I request appropriate compensation for the inconvenience and mental stress caused. Additionally, I advise other customers to be cautious when purchasing from this seller.

I hope Amazon takes this matter seriously and ensures such incidents do not happen again.

They will give you same model but built quality and RAM and ROM will be more updated version. Also remember if you think online and offline products are same then you are wrong.

The 1.96‚Äù AMOLED display is crisp and vibrant, making everything easy to read, even in bright sunlight. The stainless steel build gives it a premium look and feel‚Äîdefinitely a step up from plastic models.

The AI companion is surprisingly responsive, and I love the endless AI watch faces that let me customize the look to match my mood. The built-in GPS is accurate, which makes it perfect for outdoor workouts, and the 5 ATM water resistance gives me peace of mind during workouts and rainy days.

One of the most useless watch I ever used. This watch doesn‚Äôt remember its old step counts. One day I waked 8000 steps and it was showing the same. After few days that become 2100 steps.
After every fees days steps goes down. What‚Äôs the meaning of using such stupid watch.
Frustrating and purely waste of money.

NOTE: TV TABLE STAND IS NOT PROVIDED IN THE BOX. No Bluetooth support. Only wifi 2.4ghz is supported, no 5ghz wifi support. PICTURE & AUDIO quality is SUPERB. Supports dolby and hdr.
Buy this Only if u want reliability (samsung displays are very reliable and last long unlike cheap counterparts) , good picture and audio quality.

Bought the bezel less 2022 variant for 14,990 rupees.
Samsung is a reliable brand. Picture & quality is good. Although it's not a full hd 1080p display, at 32 inches its not apparent.

User interface is okay. Netflix app works smooth but prime video app is laggy. Tizen os is fine. So no google play store. Doesn't support chromecast, only supports Mira cast which is a different casting protocol.

Feature wise tizen os is bare minimum. But you can easily buy an android tv box to get google play functionality if u want to run android apps.

Brands like tcl, ifalconn, redmi offer more features because they run google tv\ android tv but their hardware is not reliable.

This samsung 32inches tv is great deal if u buy at 14k inr. Great picture clarity. Good sound quality. HDR works good. Samsung has great after sales customer service. So if u want good quality and reliable TV and don't care too much about having android tv os, go for this. It's a great product.

Product was intact, delivery was smooth. Open box inspection was done. It was delivered to our room where it was to be installed. It had all accessories except wall-top mount/table top, but that was provided by the Samsung , free of cost.
Display, Performance, Remote control all are functioning properly as till date. Picture quality, Sound, etc., are good too. Since it's a HD and Smart TV, the Samsung Engineer installed the Smart App and so, we can see YouTube, Samsung Tv and an other channel or two without making an account, but Netflix, and others need an account for viewing. But his is no problem. Because I purchased it for my parents and they aren't interested in watching those channels at all. The Samsung Tv has 150 channels, starting from 1000. I viewed them one by one. All were good, mostly in English. I am impressed. üëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüòÅüòÅüòÅ
The Samsung Engineer helped us a lot, in other things too, like removing the set-top box stand from one room to fix in their room, and adjusting all wires, audio-visual pins and plugs, etc.. But this was not included in his service, so, we paid him for the extra service, though he was quite reluctant to accept the payment. You know, his service included only in installing Tv and downloading Smart App to start the function. But the other service wasn't included. He did it as kindness towards us, and we paid him as a token of gratitude. With God's Grace, all was done smoothly. Thanks to Lord for providing help in his form. And thanks to dealer and Samsung brand too for providing such service. üëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüôèüôèüôèüôèüôè üíêüíêüíêüíêüíê

 Poor Seller Experience
Reviewed in India on 15 March 2025
Colour: UltramarineSize: 128 GBVerified Purchase
I am writing to formally complain about my recent purchase of an iPhone 16 from online on Amazon.
I received the item on the same day of purchase, but upon unboxing, I noticed that the iPhone came in a mismatched (muddled) box. When I powered it on, the phone was stuck on the ‚ÄúHello‚Äù screen, repeatedly displaying ‚ÄúHello‚Äù in multiple languages. It was completely unresponsive‚Äînone of the buttons, including the power and volume buttons, were functioning.

After approximately five hours, the battery finally drained, and the phone shut down. However, after restarting, the same issue persisted, with the device stuck on the ‚ÄúHello‚Äù screen again.

I contacted Amazon‚Äôs support team, who advised me to reach out to Apple Support. Apple Support suggested some troubleshooting steps, but none resolved the issue. Ultimately, they advised me to visit an Apple-authorized service center for a software reinstallation‚Äîon a brand-new phone.

I then had to travel 5 km to a Maple (Apple-authorized) service center, where they reinstalled the software. The process took about 45‚Äì50 minutes, finally making the phone functional.

I am extremely disappointed with this experience. After purchasing a costly device, I suffered an entire day of inconvenience due to the seller‚Äôs inefficiency or the company‚Äôs negligence in quality control. This is unacceptable, especially for a premium product.

Previously, I had purchased an iPhone 15 online without any issues, but this time, the experience was frustrating and disappointing. I strongly urge you to take action against this seller for supplying what appears to be old or improperly stored stock.

I request appropriate compensation for the inconvenience and mental stress caused. Additionally, I advise other customers to be cautious when purchasing from this seller.

I hope Amazon takes this matter seriously and ensures such incidents do not happen again.

NOTE: TV TABLE STAND IS NOT PROVIDED IN THE BOX. No Bluetooth support. Only wifi 2.4ghz is supported, no 5ghz wifi support. PICTURE & AUDIO quality is SUPERB. Supports dolby and hdr.
Buy this Only if u want reliability (samsung displays are very reliable and last long unlike cheap counterparts) , good picture and audio quality.

Bought the bezel less 2022 variant for 14,990 rupees.
Samsung is a reliable brand. Picture & quality is good. Although it's not a full hd 1080p display, at 32 inches its not apparent.

User interface is okay. Netflix app works smooth but prime video app is laggy. Tizen os is fine. So no google play store. Doesn't support chromecast, only supports Mira cast which is a different casting protocol.

Feature wise tizen os is bare minimum. But you can easily buy an android tv box to get google play functionality if u want to run android apps.

Brands like tcl, ifalconn, redmi offer more features because they run google tv\ android tv but their hardware is not reliable.

This samsung 32inches tv is great deal if u buy at 14k inr. Great picture clarity. Good sound quality. HDR works good. Samsung has great after sales customer service. So if u want good quality and reliable TV and don't care too much about having android tv os, go for this. It's a great product.

 Poor Seller Experience
Reviewed in India on 15 March 2025
Colour: UltramarineSize: 128 GBVerified Purchase
I am writing to formally complain about my recent purchase of an iPhone 16 from online on Amazon.
I received the item on the same day of purchase, but upon unboxing, I noticed that the iPhone came in a mismatched (muddled) box. When I powered it on, the phone was stuck on the ‚ÄúHello‚Äù screen, repeatedly displaying ‚ÄúHello‚Äù in multiple languages. It was completely unresponsive‚Äînone of the buttons, including the power and volume buttons, were functioning.

After approximately five hours, the battery finally drained, and the phone shut down. However, after restarting, the same issue persisted, with the device stuck on the ‚ÄúHello‚Äù screen again.

I contacted Amazon‚Äôs support team, who advised me to reach out to Apple Support. Apple Support suggested some troubleshooting steps, but none resolved the issue. Ultimately, they advised me to visit an Apple-authorized service center for a software reinstallation‚Äîon a brand-new phone.

I then had to travel 5 km to a Maple (Apple-authorized) service center, where they reinstalled the software. The process took about 45‚Äì50 minutes, finally making the phone functional.

I am extremely disappointed with this experience. After purchasing a costly device, I suffered an entire day of inconvenience due to the seller‚Äôs inefficiency or the company‚Äôs negligence in quality control. This is unacceptable, especially for a premium product.

Previously, I had purchased an iPhone 15 online without any issues, but this time, the experience was frustrating and disappointing. I strongly urge you to take action against this seller for supplying what appears to be old or improperly stored stock.

I request appropriate compensation for the inconvenience and mental stress caused. Additionally, I advise other customers to be cautious when purchasing from this seller.

I hope Amazon takes this matter seriously and ensures such incidents do not happen again.

 5 Stars - Excellent Product and Exceptional Customer Service!
Reviewed in India on 27 June 2024
Style Name: 65-LitreVerified Purchase
I recently purchased the Crompton Optimus Desert Air Cooler (65L) and I'm thoroughly impressed with both the product and the seller's service.

Product Review:
The cooler is well-built with high-quality plastic that feels durable. The honeycomb pads are highly effective, efficiently cooling the room without excessive noise. A standout feature is the ice chamber conveniently located at the top, which enhances the cooling effect.
Initially, I encountered a minor issue with water distribution to the honeycomb pads. However, this leads me to the most impressive part of my experience - the customer service.

Seller Service:
When I shared the issue during their follow-up for a review, the seller's reaction was swift and customer-focused. They immediately offered to replace the cooler, no questions asked. The next day, they sent someone to deliver a new unit and take back the faulty one.
This level of service went above and beyond my expectations. It was far more convenient than having to ship such a large item myself, which Amazon had initially suggested. The seller's proactive approach, quick resolution, and hassle-free replacement process were truly impressive.

I recommend both this cooler and this seller. The product is efficient and well-designed, and with this level of after-sales support, I couldn't be happier with my purchase. It's refreshing to see a company that stands behind their product and prioritizes customer satisfaction to this degree.

Reviewed in India on 9 March 2025
Style Name: 100-LitreVerified Purchase
Plastic Material Discrepancy:
Notably, the ice chamber and cover are constructed from noticeably different plastics, both in texture and color. The chamber boasts a sturdier feel, while the cover feels flimsy and is of a distinctly different hue. This inconsistency in material quality is concerning, particularly for a product of this nature.

Cover Fitment Issues:
The cover's inability to close properly is a recurring annoyance, requiring undue force to secure it in place. Furthermore, its bent appearance near the corners suggests a lack of precision in the manufacturing process, leading to frustration during use.

Mosquito Net Blockage: Examination reveals that portions of the mosquito netting are completely sealed off, raising doubts about the effectiveness of ventilation. Such blockages could impede airflow to the honeycomb pad, potentially compromising the unit's cooling capabilities and placing undue strain on the fan mechanism.

Body Gaps:
Upon closer inspection, it becomes evident that there are multiple areas where the various components of the body fail to align seamlessly. These visible gaps suggest a lack of attention to detail during assembly, detracting from the product's overall aesthetic and functionality.

 Very good product crompton Desert air cooler

Style Name: 65-LitreVerified Purchase
Very good product crompton.
Air cooler size am not expect this much height .
It's very tall optimus 65 model.
It's suitable for big size hall ....
2 days am used this product ....
Cooling wise it's so wonderful am filling light hot water inside the chamber but output it's give cooling & breeze air .
First day approximately I filled 60-62 ltr water afternoon 1 to evening 8 o clock it's continuously running and comes under min level.

Second day filled 60 LTR water using at night time
9 pm to morning 5 am .
So average 8 hours it's running full tank capacity.

Noise wise quit good . Very pleasant .

First day full of honeycomb smell in hall .
But second day it's not in machine .
So smell so horrible at day 1 . So pls out of children from this cooler day 1.

Before operate & run the aircooler kindly check bottom chamber I identified two screw inside the water chamber.
I dont know how it's happened may be travelling time it may be happen .
So before check water chamber then you run it your cooler.

Note : Water issue area people & metro people
per day it's consump 60 ltr water so cost it around
25*3 water cane = 60 ruppes
60*30 days = 1800 rupees
+
Current bill consumption you add so total it around 2100 RS it's come monthly charge .
So my personal opinion
If you need aircooler for your home think & buy.
If water problem not in your area.
If water problem is there in your area kindly think and buy .

Thankyou

 PLASTIC FAN with ordinary plastic body and cheap workmanship
Reviewed in India on 15 March 2025
Style Name: 100-LitreVerified Purchase
The fan should be always metal. I had upgraded from Ozone 75 to this assuming blindly that the fan would be metal as was with the earlier. The fan is made of plastic and has only 3 wings. My old ozone 75 had 5 metal wings. The plastic was better, and over-all workmanship was good. The plastic here is flimsy and has lots of semi finished parts to it. There are a lot of gaps everywhere, the front grill is having so big gaps that a small kid can easily put his/her hands in as the louvers are way too flexible. Throw is ok, sound is reduced a bit. But thoroughly disappointed. Thought Crompton knew how to make a desert cooler. I guess I should have relied on my local, super trusterd Nagpur cooler vendor, Ram Coolers. Just hoping the motor should be good as I am thinking of changing the fan soon. Hope I can trust Crompton with atleast the fan motors.

Product is very good but I will suggest if you are paying 13000 and purchasing in online mode then pls pay 2000 more and go offline and buy from shop. They will give you same model but built quality and RAM and ROM will be more updated version. Also remember if you think online and offline products are same then you are wrong.

NOTE: TV TABLE STAND IS NOT PROVIDED IN THE BOX. No Bluetooth support. Only wifi 2.4ghz is supported, no 5ghz wifi support. PICTURE & AUDIO quality is SUPERB. Supports dolby and hdr.
Buy this Only if u want reliability (samsung displays are very reliable and last long unlike cheap counterparts) , good picture and audio quality.

Bought the bezel less 2022 variant for 14,990 rupees.
Samsung is a reliable brand. Picture & quality is good. Although it's not a full hd 1080p display, at 32 inches its not apparent.

User interface is okay. Netflix app works smooth but prime video app is laggy. Tizen os is fine. So no google play store. Doesn't support chromecast, only supports Mira cast which is a different casting protocol.

Feature wise tizen os is bare minimum. But you can easily buy an android tv box to get google play functionality if u want to run android apps.

Brands like tcl, ifalconn, redmi offer more features because they run google tv\ android tv but their hardware is not reliable.

This samsung 32inches tv is great deal if u buy at 14k inr. Great picture clarity. Good sound quality. HDR works good. Samsung has great after sales customer service. So if u want good quality and reliable TV and don't care too much about having android tv os, go for this. It's a great product.

Product was intact, delivery was smooth. Open box inspection was done. It was delivered to our room where it was to be installed. It had all accessories except wall-top mount/table top, but that was provided by the Samsung , free of cost.
Display, Performance, Remote control all are functioning properly as till date. Picture quality, Sound, etc., are good too. Since it's a HD and Smart TV, the Samsung Engineer installed the Smart App and so, we can see YouTube, Samsung Tv and an other channel or two without making an account, but Netflix, and others need an account for viewing. But his is no problem. Because I purchased it for my parents and they aren't interested in watching those channels at all. The Samsung Tv has 150 channels, starting from 1000. I viewed them one by one. All were good, mostly in English. I am impressed. üëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüòÅüòÅüòÅ
The Samsung Engineer helped us a lot, in other things too, like removing the set-top box stand from one room to fix in their room, and adjusting all wires, audio-visual pins and plugs, etc.. But this was not included in his service, so, we paid him for the extra service, though he was quite reluctant to accept the payment. You know, his service included only in installing Tv and downloading Smart App to start the function. But the other service wasn't included. He did it as kindness towards us, and we paid him as a token of gratitude. With God's Grace, all was done smoothly. Thanks to Lord for providing help in his form. And thanks to dealer and Samsung brand too for providing such service. üëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüôèüôèüôèüôèüôè üíêüíêüíêüíêüíê

 Poor Seller Experience
Reviewed in India on 15 March 2025
Colour: UltramarineSize: 128 GBVerified Purchase
I am writing to formally complain about my recent purchase of an iPhone 16 from online on Amazon.
I received the item on the same day of purchase, but upon unboxing, I noticed that the iPhone came in a mismatched (muddled) box. When I powered it on, the phone was stuck on the ‚ÄúHello‚Äù screen, repeatedly displaying ‚ÄúHello‚Äù in multiple languages. It was completely unresponsive‚Äînone of the buttons, including the power and volume buttons, were functioning.

After approximately five hours, the battery finally drained, and the phone shut down. However, after restarting, the same issue persisted, with the device stuck on the ‚ÄúHello‚Äù screen again.

I contacted Amazon‚Äôs support team, who advised me to reach out to Apple Support. Apple Support suggested some troubleshooting steps, but none resolved the issue. Ultimately, they advised me to visit an Apple-authorized service center for a software reinstallation‚Äîon a brand-new phone.

I then had to travel 5 km to a Maple (Apple-authorized) service center, where they reinstalled the software. The process took about 45‚Äì50 minutes, finally making the phone functional.

I am extremely disappointed with this experience. After purchasing a costly device, I suffered an entire day of inconvenience due to the seller‚Äôs inefficiency or the company‚Äôs negligence in quality control. This is unacceptable, especially for a premium product.

Previously, I had purchased an iPhone 15 online without any issues, but this time, the experience was frustrating and disappointing. I strongly urge you to take action against this seller for supplying what appears to be old or improperly stored stock.

I request appropriate compensation for the inconvenience and mental stress caused. Additionally, I advise other customers to be cautious when purchasing from this seller.

I hope Amazon takes this matter seriously and ensures such incidents do not happen again.

I then had to travel 5 km to a Maple (Apple-authorized) service center, where they reinstalled the software. The process took about 45‚Äì50 minutes, finally making the phone functional.

I am extremely disappointed with this experience. After purchasing a costly device, I suffered an entire day of inconvenience due to the seller‚Äôs inefficiency or the company‚Äôs negligence in quality control. This is unacceptable, especially for a premium product.

Previously, I had purchased an iPhone 15 online without any issues, but this time, the experience was frustrating and disappointing. I strongly urge you to take action against this seller for supplying what appears to be old or improperly stored stock.

I request appropriate compensation for the inconvenience and mental stress caused. Additionally, I advise other customers to be cautious when purchasing from this seller.

I hope Amazon takes this matter seriously and ensures such incidents do not happen again.

 Feature-Packed Smartwatch with a Premium Feel!
Reviewed in India on 18 February 2025
Colour: Jet BlackVerified Purchase
I‚Äôve been using the Noise Pro 6 Max Smart Watch for a few weeks now, and it‚Äôs been a fantastic experience! The 1.96‚Äù AMOLED display is crisp and vibrant, making everything easy to read, even in bright sunlight. The stainless steel build gives it a premium look and feel‚Äîdefinitely a step up from plastic models.

The AI companion is surprisingly responsive, and I love the endless AI watch faces that let me customize the look to match my mood. The built-in GPS is accurate, which makes it perfect for outdoor workouts, and the 5 ATM water resistance gives me peace of mind during workouts and rainy days.

The EN2 Processor ensures smooth performance, with no lag when switching between apps. Plus, it works seamlessly with both iOS and Android devices, which is a huge plus.

Overall, this smartwatch offers great value for money with its advanced features and sleek design. Highly recommended! ‚åöüíØ

NOTE: TV TABLE STAND IS NOT PROVIDED IN THE BOX. No Bluetooth support. Only wifi 2.4ghz is supported, no 5ghz wifi support. PICTURE & AUDIO quality is SUPERB. Supports dolby and hdr.
Buy this Only if u want reliability (samsung displays are very reliable and last long unlike cheap counterparts) , good picture and audio quality.

Bought the bezel less 2022 variant for 14,990 rupees.
Samsung is a reliable brand. Picture & quality is good. Although it's not a full hd 1080p display, at 32 inches its not apparent.

User interface is okay. Netflix app works smooth but prime video app is laggy. Tizen os is fine. So no google play store. Doesn't support chromecast, only supports Mira cast which is a different casting protocol.

Feature wise tizen os is bare minimum. But you can easily buy an android tv box to get google play functionality if u want to run android apps.

Brands like tcl, ifalconn, redmi offer more features because they run google tv\ android tv but their hardware is not reliable.

This samsung 32inches tv is great deal if u buy at 14k inr. Great picture clarity. Good sound quality. HDR works good. Samsung has great after sales customer service. So if u want good quality and reliable TV and don't care too much about having android tv os, go for this. It's a great product.

Product was intact, delivery was smooth. Open box inspection was done. It was delivered to our room where it was to be installed. It had all accessories except wall-top mount/table top, but that was provided by the Samsung , free of cost.
Display, Performance, Remote control all are functioning properly as till date. Picture quality, Sound, etc., are good too. Since it's a HD and Smart TV, the Samsung Engineer installed the Smart App and so, we can see YouTube, Samsung Tv and an other channel or two without making an account, but Netflix, and others need an account for viewing. But his is no problem. Because I purchased it for my parents and they aren't interested in watching those channels at all. The Samsung Tv has 150 channels, starting from 1000. I viewed them one by one. All were good, mostly in English. I am impressed. üëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüòÅüòÅüòÅ
The Samsung Engineer helped us a lot, in other things too, like removing the set-top box stand from one room to fix in their room, and adjusting all wires, audio-visual pins and plugs, etc.. But this was not included in his service, so, we paid him for the extra service, though he was quite reluctant to accept the payment. You know, his service included only in installing Tv and downloading Smart App to start the function. But the other service wasn't included. He did it as kindness towards us, and we paid him as a token of gratitude. With God's Grace, all was done smoothly. Thanks to Lord for providing help in his form. And thanks to dealer and Samsung brand too for providing such service. üëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüôèüôèüôèüôèüôè üíêüíêüíêüíêüíê

Product was intact, delivery was smooth. Open box inspection was done. It was delivered to our room where it was to be installed. It had all accessories except wall-top mount/table top, but that was provided by the Samsung , free of cost.
Display, Performance, Remote control all are functioning properly as till date. Picture quality, Sound, etc., are good too. Since it's a HD and Smart TV, the Samsung Engineer installed the Smart App and so, we can see YouTube, Samsung Tv and an other channel or two without making an account, but Netflix, and others need an account for viewing. But his is no problem. Because I purchased it for my parents and they aren't interested in watching those channels at all. The Samsung Tv has 150 channels, starting from 1000. I viewed them one by one. All were good, mostly in English. I am impressed. üëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüòÅüòÅüòÅ
The Samsung Engineer helped us a lot, in other things too, like removing the set-top box stand from one room to fix in their room, and adjusting all wires, audio-visual pins and plugs, etc.. But this was not included in his service, so, we paid him for the extra service, though he was quite reluctant to accept the payment. You know, his service included only in installing Tv and downloading Smart App to start the function. But the other service wasn't included. He did it as kindness towards us, and we paid him as a token of gratitude. With God's Grace, all was done smoothly. Thanks to Lord for providing help in his form. And thanks to dealer and Samsung brand too for providing such service. üëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüôèüôèüôèüôèüôè üíêüíêüíêüíêüíê

Product is very good but I will suggest if you are paying 13000 and purchasing in online mode then pls pay 2000 more and go offline and buy from shop. They will give you same model but built quality and RAM and ROM will be more updated version. Also remember if you think online and offline products are same then you are wrong.

NOTE: TV TABLE STAND IS NOT PROVIDED IN THE BOX. No Bluetooth support. Only wifi 2.4ghz is supported, no 5ghz wifi support. PICTURE & AUDIO quality is SUPERB. Supports dolby and hdr.
Buy this Only if u want reliability (samsung displays are very reliable and last long unlike cheap counterparts) , good picture and audio quality.

Bought the bezel less 2022 variant for 14,990 rupees.
Samsung is a reliable brand. Picture & quality is good. Although it's not a full hd 1080p display, at 32 inches its not apparent.

User interface is okay. Netflix app works smooth but prime video app is laggy. Tizen os is fine. So no google play store. Doesn't support chromecast, only supports Mira cast which is a different casting protocol.

Feature wise tizen os is bare minimum. But you can easily buy an android tv box to get google play functionality if u want to run android apps.

Brands like tcl, ifalconn, redmi offer more features because they run google tv\ android tv but their hardware is not reliable.

This samsung 32inches tv is great deal if u buy at 14k inr. Great picture clarity. Good sound quality. HDR works good. Samsung has great after sales customer service. So if u want good quality and reliable TV and don't care too much about having android tv os, go for this. It's a great product.

 Poor Seller Experience
Reviewed in India on 15 March 2025
Colour: UltramarineSize: 128 GBVerified Purchase
I am writing to formally complain about my recent purchase of an iPhone 16 from online on Amazon.
I received the item on the same day of purchase, but upon unboxing, I noticed that the iPhone came in a mismatched (muddled) box. When I powered it on, the phone was stuck on the ‚ÄúHello‚Äù screen, repeatedly displaying ‚ÄúHello‚Äù in multiple languages. It was completely unresponsive‚Äînone of the buttons, including the power and volume buttons, were functioning.

After approximately five hours, the battery finally drained, and the phone shut down. However, after restarting, the same issue persisted, with the device stuck on the ‚ÄúHello‚Äù screen again.

I contacted Amazon‚Äôs support team, who advised me to reach out to Apple Support. Apple Support suggested some troubleshooting steps, but none resolved the issue. Ultimately, they advised me to visit an Apple-authorized service center for a software reinstallation‚Äîon a brand-new phone.

I then had to travel 5 km to a Maple (Apple-authorized) service center, where they reinstalled the software. The process took about 45‚Äì50 minutes, finally making the phone functional.

I am extremely disappointed with this experience. After purchasing a costly device, I suffered an entire day of inconvenience due to the seller‚Äôs inefficiency or the company‚Äôs negligence in quality control. This is unacceptable, especially for a premium product.

Previously, I had purchased an iPhone 15 online without any issues, but this time, the experience was frustrating and disappointing. I strongly urge you to take action against this seller for supplying what appears to be old or improperly stored stock.

I request appropriate compensation for the inconvenience and mental stress caused. Additionally, I advise other customers to be cautious when purchasing from this seller.

I hope Amazon takes this matter seriously and ensures such incidents do not happen again.

 5 Stars - Excellent Product and Exceptional Customer Service!
Reviewed in India on 27 June 2024
Style Name: 65-LitreVerified Purchase
I recently purchased the Crompton Optimus Desert Air Cooler (65L) and I'm thoroughly impressed with both the product and the seller's service.

Product Review:
The cooler is well-built with high-quality plastic that feels durable. The honeycomb pads are highly effective, efficiently cooling the room without excessive noise. A standout feature is the ice chamber conveniently located at the top, which enhances the cooling effect.
Initially, I encountered a minor issue with water distribution to the honeycomb pads. However, this leads me to the most impressive part of my experience - the customer service.

Seller Service:
When I shared the issue during their follow-up for a review, the seller's reaction was swift and customer-focused. They immediately offered to replace the cooler, no questions asked. The next day, they sent someone to deliver a new unit and take back the faulty one.
This level of service went above and beyond my expectations. It was far more convenient than having to ship such a large item myself, which Amazon had initially suggested. The seller's proactive approach, quick resolution, and hassle-free replacement process were truly impressive.

I recommend both this cooler and this seller. The product is efficient and well-designed, and with this level of after-sales support, I couldn't be happier with my purchase. It's refreshing to see a company that stands behind their product and prioritizes customer satisfaction to this degree.

Plastic Material Discrepancy:
Notably, the ice chamber and cover are constructed from noticeably different plastics, both in texture and color. The chamber boasts a sturdier feel, while the cover feels flimsy and is of a distinctly different hue. This inconsistency in material quality is concerning, particularly for a product of this nature.

Cover Fitment Issues:
The cover's inability to close properly is a recurring annoyance, requiring undue force to secure it in place. Furthermore, its bent appearance near the corners suggests a lack of precision in the manufacturing process, leading to frustration during use.

Mosquito Net Blockage: Examination reveals that portions of the mosquito netting are completely sealed off, raising doubts about the effectiveness of ventilation. Such blockages could impede airflow to the honeycomb pad, potentially compromising the unit's cooling capabilities and placing undue strain on the fan mechanism.

Body Gaps:
Upon closer inspection, it becomes evident that there are multiple areas where the various components of the body fail to align seamlessly. These visible gaps suggest a lack of attention to detail during assembly, detracting from the product's overall aesthetic and functionality.

Style Name: 65-LitreVerified Purchase
Very good product crompton.
Air cooler size am not expect this much height .
It's very tall optimus 65 model.
It's suitable for big size hall ....
2 days am used this product ....
Cooling wise it's so wonderful am filling light hot water inside the chamber but output it's give cooling & breeze air .
First day approximately I filled 60-62 ltr water afternoon 1 to evening 8 o clock it's continuously running and comes under min level.

Second day filled 60 LTR water using at night time
9 pm to morning 5 am .
So average 8 hours it's running full tank capacity.

Noise wise quit good . Very pleasant .

First day full of honeycomb smell in hall .
But second day it's not in machine .
So smell so horrible at day 1 . So pls out of children from this cooler day 1.

Before operate & run the aircooler kindly check bottom chamber I identified two screw inside the water chamber.
I dont know how it's happened may be travelling time it may be happen .
So before check water chamber then you run it your cooler.

Note : Water issue area people & metro people
per day it's consump 60 ltr water so cost it around
25*3 water cane = 60 ruppes
60*30 days = 1800 rupees
+
Current bill consumption you add so total it around 2100 RS it's come monthly charge .
So my personal opinion
If you need aircooler for your home think & buy.
If water problem not in your area.
If water problem is there in your area kindly think and buy .

Thankyou

 PLASTIC FAN with ordinary plastic body and cheap workmanship
Reviewed in India on 15 March 2025
Style Name: 100-LitreVerified Purchase
The fan should be always metal. I had upgraded from Ozone 75 to this assuming blindly that the fan would be metal as was with the earlier. The fan is made of plastic and has only 3 wings. My old ozone 75 had 5 metal wings. The plastic was better, and over-all workmanship was good. The plastic here is flimsy and has lots of semi finished parts to it. There are a lot of gaps everywhere, the front grill is having so big gaps that a small kid can easily put his/her hands in as the louvers are way too flexible. Throw is ok, sound is reduced a bit. But thoroughly disappointed. Thought Crompton knew how to make a desert cooler. I guess I should have relied on my local, super trusterd Nagpur cooler vendor, Ram Coolers. Just hoping the motor should be good as I am thinking of changing the fan soon. Hope I can trust Crompton with atleast the fan motors.

Colour: 2022 - Dazzle Steel | ConvertibleVerified Purchase
Exchange facility
Amazon exchange facility is much better than Flipkart. For the same old fridge (which was 17 yrs old but in good working condition), Flipkart refused to accept saying there are a few (minor) rust marks at bottom of door whereas Amazon accepted without any fuss.

Price
After researching on various 335ltr models, decided on this one due to features and price. Bought on 24-Oct-20 for a effective price of INR 27,500 after exchange, discounts and card cashback.

Delivery & Installation
The new fridge was delivered in good condition without any scratch or damage. Since I was without a fridge when the new one was delivered at 12pm (old taken away in exchange), the LG technician accepted my request to come the same day (at 4pm) and install the new one. I am thankful for this excellent gesture on his part.

Pros
The fridge area is spacious and feels bigger than the earlier LG 390 ltrs model which I was using. This is becos of the more shelves in this model. The pull out tray and the convertible box (above the veg bin) are very useful. The cooling at mid settings is good. The external look in very elegant. The build quality is very good and the fridge has sturdy look overall.

Cons
The vegetable / fruit storage bin at the bottom seems constricted in size and does not move freely. The inside area of freezer compartment also seems smaller as compared to the view from outside. The ice trays / storage occupy much space. No light in the freezer - not sure why LG does not install (even my 17 yr old did not have) inspite of its usefulness and every review mentioning this as a drawback. The user manual is very basic and does not explain the high / low feature in the convertible box / veg bin.

Overall
Though the cons look more, they are not so significant as compared to the good features. I am satisfied with this model and will recommend it.

I think this company don‚Äôt even have an application where the agent can send a pic of the Customer building, so that it confirms he or she visited the customer location, they gave another option like contact was made but unable to reach customer, wooooow amazing, if he made a contact to the customer, this company app should witness the customer number, in this way should confirm, because of I‚Äôm staying in 2nd floor, they don‚Äôt want to deliver on the floor, then why Amazon accepting the order, if they are charging for the 2nd, 1st floor separately, we are ok to pay but this a wooooorst company where only one person delivering the refrigerator. What if the senior citizens staying on 2nd floor.
After reading this review people will think that , it‚Äôs not a company mistake, it‚Äôs mistake of agents.
Woooooooow
Keeping this I have asked few questions with agents he said, company only saying that not to deliver the product on the 2nd floor separately, deliver on ground floor, it doesn‚Äôt matter where they are staying.
From this I understood, company thinking about money not about growing in the future.
So, Amazon has open their eyes, think once again to do business with this wooooorst company.

Thank you.

Product is very good but I will suggest if you are paying 13000 and purchasing in online mode then pls pay 2000 more and go offline and buy from shop. They will give you same model but built quality and RAM and ROM will be more updated version. Also remember if you think online and offline products are same then you are wrong.

Size: 32 inches | HD Smart Bezel-less DesignVerified Purchase
NOTE: TV TABLE STAND IS NOT PROVIDED IN THE BOX. No Bluetooth support. Only wifi 2.4ghz is supported, no 5ghz wifi support. PICTURE & AUDIO quality is SUPERB. Supports dolby and hdr.
Buy this Only if u want reliability (samsung displays are very reliable and last long unlike cheap counterparts) , good picture and audio quality.

Bought the bezel less 2022 variant for 14,990 rupees.
Samsung is a reliable brand. Picture & quality is good. Although it's not a full hd 1080p display, at 32 inches its not apparent.

User interface is okay. Netflix app works smooth but prime video app is laggy. Tizen os is fine. So no google play store. Doesn't support chromecast, only supports Mira cast which is a different casting protocol.

Feature wise tizen os is bare minimum. But you can easily buy an android tv box to get google play functionality if u want to run android apps.

Brands like tcl, ifalconn, redmi offer more features because they run google tv\ android tv but their hardware is not reliable.

This samsung 32inches tv is great deal if u buy at 14k inr. Great picture clarity. Good sound quality. HDR works good. Samsung has great after sales customer service. So if u want good quality and reliable TV and don't care too much about having android tv os, go for this. It's a great product.

Product was intact, delivery was smooth. Open box inspection was done. It was delivered to our room where it was to be installed. It had all accessories except wall-top mount/table top, but that was provided by the Samsung , free of cost.
Display, Performance, Remote control all are functioning properly as till date. Picture quality, Sound, etc., are good too. Since it's a HD and Smart TV, the Samsung Engineer installed the Smart App and so, we can see YouTube, Samsung Tv and an other channel or two without making an account, but Netflix, and others need an account for viewing. But his is no problem. Because I purchased it for my parents and they aren't interested in watching those channels at all. The Samsung Tv has 150 channels, starting from 1000. I viewed them one by one. All were good, mostly in English. I am impressed. üëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüòÅüòÅüòÅ
The Samsung Engineer helped us a lot, in other things too, like removing the set-top box stand from one room to fix in their room, and adjusting all wires, audio-visual pins and plugs, etc.. But this was not included in his service, so, we paid him for the extra service, though he was quite reluctant to accept the payment. You know, his service included only in installing Tv and downloading Smart App to start the function. But the other service wasn't included. He did it as kindness towards us, and we paid him as a token of gratitude. With God's Grace, all was done smoothly. Thanks to Lord for providing help in his form. And thanks to dealer and Samsung brand too for providing such service. üëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüôèüôèüôèüôèüôè üíêüíêüíêüíêüíê

 Poor Seller Experience
Reviewed in India on 15 March 2025
Colour: UltramarineSize: 128 GBVerified Purchase
I am writing to formally complain about my recent purchase of an iPhone 16 from online on Amazon.
I received the item on the same day of purchase, but upon unboxing, I noticed that the iPhone came in a mismatched (muddled) box. When I powered it on, the phone was stuck on the ‚ÄúHello‚Äù screen, repeatedly displaying ‚ÄúHello‚Äù in multiple languages. It was completely unresponsive‚Äînone of the buttons, including the power and volume buttons, were functioning.

After approximately five hours, the battery finally drained, and the phone shut down. However, after restarting, the same issue persisted, with the device stuck on the ‚ÄúHello‚Äù screen again.

I contacted Amazon‚Äôs support team, who advised me to reach out to Apple Support. Apple Support suggested some troubleshooting steps, but none resolved the issue. Ultimately, they advised me to visit an Apple-authorized service center for a software reinstallation‚Äîon a brand-new phone.

I then had to travel 5 km to a Maple (Apple-authorized) service center, where they reinstalled the software. The process took about 45‚Äì50 minutes, finally making the phone functional.

I am extremely disappointed with this experience. After purchasing a costly device, I suffered an entire day of inconvenience due to the seller‚Äôs inefficiency or the company‚Äôs negligence in quality control. This is unacceptable, especially for a premium product.

Previously, I had purchased an iPhone 15 online without any issues, but this time, the experience was frustrating and disappointing. I strongly urge you to take action against this seller for supplying what appears to be old or improperly stored stock.

I request appropriate compensation for the inconvenience and mental stress caused. Additionally, I advise other customers to be cautious when purchasing from this seller.

I hope Amazon takes this matter seriously and ensures such incidents do not happen again.

 Great quality tv at a decent price but lacks alof of features

Size: 32 inches | HD Smart Bezel-less DesignVerified Purchase
NOTE: TV TABLE STAND IS NOT PROVIDED IN THE BOX. No Bluetooth support. Only wifi 2.4ghz is supported, no 5ghz wifi support. PICTURE & AUDIO quality is SUPERB. Supports dolby and hdr.
Buy this Only if u want reliability (samsung displays are very reliable and last long unlike cheap counterparts) , good picture and audio quality.

Bought the bezel less 2022 variant for 14,990 rupees.
Samsung is a reliable brand. Picture & quality is good. Although it's not a full hd 1080p display, at 32 inches its not apparent.

User interface is okay. Netflix app works smooth but prime video app is laggy. Tizen os is fine. So no google play store. Doesn't support chromecast, only supports Mira cast which is a different casting protocol.

Feature wise tizen os is bare minimum. But you can easily buy an android tv box to get google play functionality if u want to run android apps.

Brands like tcl, ifalconn, redmi offer more features because they run google tv\ android tv but their hardware is not reliable.

This samsung 32inches tv is great deal if u buy at 14k inr. Great picture clarity. Good sound quality. HDR works good. Samsung has great after sales customer service. So if u want good quality and reliable TV and don't care too much about having android tv os, go for this. It's a great product.

Product was intact, delivery was smooth. Open box inspection was done. It was delivered to our room where it was to be installed. It had all accessories except wall-top mount/table top, but that was provided by the Samsung , free of cost.
Display, Performance, Remote control all are functioning properly as till date. Picture quality, Sound, etc., are good too. Since it's a HD and Smart TV, the Samsung Engineer installed the Smart App and so, we can see YouTube, Samsung Tv and an other channel or two without making an account, but Netflix, and others need an account for viewing. But his is no problem. Because I purchased it for my parents and they aren't interested in watching those channels at all. The Samsung Tv has 150 channels, starting from 1000. I viewed them one by one. All were good, mostly in English. I am impressed. üëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüòÅüòÅüòÅ
The Samsung Engineer helped us a lot, in other things too, like removing the set-top box stand from one room to fix in their room, and adjusting all wires, audio-visual pins and plugs, etc.. But this was not included in his service, so, we paid him for the extra service, though he was quite reluctant to accept the payment. You know, his service included only in installing Tv and downloading Smart App to start the function. But the other service wasn't included. He did it as kindness towards us, and we paid him as a token of gratitude. With God's Grace, all was done smoothly. Thanks to Lord for providing help in his form. And thanks to dealer and Samsung brand too for providing such service. üëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüôèüôèüôèüôèüôè üíêüíêüíêüíêüíê

 Poor Seller Experience
Reviewed in India on 15 March 2025
Colour: UltramarineSize: 128 GBVerified Purchase
I am writing to formally complain about my recent purchase of an iPhone 16 from online on Amazon.
I received the item on the same day of purchase, but upon unboxing, I noticed that the iPhone came in a mismatched (muddled) box. When I powered it on, the phone was stuck on the ‚ÄúHello‚Äù screen, repeatedly displaying ‚ÄúHello‚Äù in multiple languages. It was completely unresponsive‚Äînone of the buttons, including the power and volume buttons, were functioning.

After approximately five hours, the battery finally drained, and the phone shut down. However, after restarting, the same issue persisted, with the device stuck on the ‚ÄúHello‚Äù screen again.

I contacted Amazon‚Äôs support team, who advised me to reach out to Apple Support. Apple Support suggested some troubleshooting steps, but none resolved the issue. Ultimately, they advised me to visit an Apple-authorized service center for a software reinstallation‚Äîon a brand-new phone.

I then had to travel 5 km to a Maple (Apple-authorized) service center, where they reinstalled the software. The process took about 45‚Äì50 minutes, finally making the phone functional.

I am extremely disappointed with this experience. After purchasing a costly device, I suffered an entire day of inconvenience due to the seller‚Äôs inefficiency or the company‚Äôs negligence in quality control. This is unacceptable, especially for a premium product.

Previously, I had purchased an iPhone 15 online without any issues, but this time, the experience was frustrating and disappointing. I strongly urge you to take action against this seller for supplying what appears to be old or improperly stored stock.

I request appropriate compensation for the inconvenience and mental stress caused. Additionally, I advise other customers to be cautious when purchasing from this seller.

I hope Amazon takes this matter seriously and ensures such incidents do not happen again.

I‚Äôve been using the Noise Pro 6 Max Smart Watch for a few weeks now, and it‚Äôs been a fantastic experience! The 1.96‚Äù AMOLED display is crisp and vibrant, making everything easy to read, even in bright sunlight. The stainless steel build gives it a premium look and feel‚Äîdefinitely a step up from plastic models.

The AI companion is surprisingly responsive, and I love the endless AI watch faces that let me customize the look to match my mood. The built-in GPS is accurate, which makes it perfect for outdoor workouts, and the 5 ATM water resistance gives me peace of mind during workouts and rainy days.

The EN2 Processor ensures smooth performance, with no lag when switching between apps. Plus, it works seamlessly with both iOS and Android devices, which is a huge plus.

Overall, this smartwatch offers great value for money with its advanced features and sleek design. Highly recommended! ‚åöüíØ

 Poor Seller Experience
Reviewed in India on 15 March 2025
Colour: UltramarineSize: 128 GBVerified Purchase
I am writing to formally complain about my recent purchase of an iPhone 16 from online on Amazon.
I received the item on the same day of purchase, but upon unboxing, I noticed that the iPhone came in a mismatched (muddled) box. When I powered it on, the phone was stuck on the ‚ÄúHello‚Äù screen, repeatedly displaying ‚ÄúHello‚Äù in multiple languages. It was completely unresponsive‚Äînone of the buttons, including the power and volume buttons, were functioning.

After approximately five hours, the battery finally drained, and the phone shut down. However, after restarting, the same issue persisted, with the device stuck on the ‚ÄúHello‚Äù screen again.

I contacted Amazon‚Äôs support team, who advised me to reach out to Apple Support. Apple Support suggested some troubleshooting steps, but none resolved the issue. Ultimately, they advised me to visit an Apple-authorized service center for a software reinstallation‚Äîon a brand-new phone.

I then had to travel 5 km to a Maple (Apple-authorized) service center, where they reinstalled the software. The process took about 45‚Äì50 minutes, finally making the phone functional.

I am extremely disappointed with this experience. After purchasing a costly device, I suffered an entire day of inconvenience due to the seller‚Äôs inefficiency or the company‚Äôs negligence in quality control. This is unacceptable, especially for a premium product.

Previously, I had purchased an iPhone 15 online without any issues, but this time, the experience was frustrating and disappointing. I strongly urge you to take action against this seller for supplying what appears to be old or improperly stored stock.

I request appropriate compensation for the inconvenience and mental stress caused. Additionally, I advise other customers to be cautious when purchasing from this seller.

I hope Amazon takes this matter seriously and ensures such incidents do not happen again.

NOTE: TV TABLE STAND IS NOT PROVIDED IN THE BOX. No Bluetooth support. Only wifi 2.4ghz is supported, no 5ghz wifi support. PICTURE & AUDIO quality is SUPERB. Supports dolby and hdr.
Buy this Only if u want reliability (samsung displays are very reliable and last long unlike cheap counterparts) , good picture and audio quality.

Bought the bezel less 2022 variant for 14,990 rupees.
Samsung is a reliable brand. Picture & quality is good. Although it's not a full hd 1080p display, at 32 inches its not apparent.

User interface is okay. Netflix app works smooth but prime video app is laggy. Tizen os is fine. So no google play store. Doesn't support chromecast, only supports Mira cast which is a different casting protocol.

Feature wise tizen os is bare minimum. But you can easily buy an android tv box to get google play functionality if u want to run android apps.

Brands like tcl, ifalconn, redmi offer more features because they run google tv\ android tv but their hardware is not reliable.

This samsung 32inches tv is great deal if u buy at 14k inr. Great picture clarity. Good sound quality. HDR works good. Samsung has great after sales customer service. So if u want good quality and reliable TV and don't care too much about having android tv os, go for this. It's a great product.

Product was intact, delivery was smooth. Open box inspection was done. It was delivered to our room where it was to be installed. It had all accessories except wall-top mount/table top, but that was provided by the Samsung , free of cost.
Display, Performance, Remote control all are functioning properly as till date. Picture quality, Sound, etc., are good too. Since it's a HD and Smart TV, the Samsung Engineer installed the Smart App and so, we can see YouTube, Samsung Tv and an other channel or two without making an account, but Netflix, and others need an account for viewing. But his is no problem. Because I purchased it for my parents and they aren't interested in watching those channels at all. The Samsung Tv has 150 channels, starting from 1000. I viewed them one by one. All were good, mostly in English. I am impressed. üëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüòÅüòÅüòÅ
The Samsung Engineer helped us a lot, in other things too, like removing the set-top box stand from one room to fix in their room, and adjusting all wires, audio-visual pins and plugs, etc.. But this was not included in his service, so, we paid him for the extra service, though he was quite reluctant to accept the payment. You know, his service included only in installing Tv and downloading Smart App to start the function. But the other service wasn't included. He did it as kindness towards us, and we paid him as a token of gratitude. With God's Grace, all was done smoothly. Thanks to Lord for providing help in his form. And thanks to dealer and Samsung brand too for providing such service. üëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüôèüôèüôèüôèüôè üíêüíêüíêüíêüíê

 5 Stars - Excellent Product and Exceptional Customer Service!
Reviewed in India on 27 June 2024
Style Name: 65-LitreVerified Purchase
I recently purchased the Crompton Optimus Desert Air Cooler (65L) and I'm thoroughly impressed with both the product and the seller's service.

Product Review:
The cooler is well-built with high-quality plastic that feels durable. The honeycomb pads are highly effective, efficiently cooling the room without excessive noise. A standout feature is the ice chamber conveniently located at the top, which enhances the cooling effect.
Initially, I encountered a minor issue with water distribution to the honeycomb pads. However, this leads me to the most impressive part of my experience - the customer service.

Seller Service:
When I shared the issue during their follow-up for a review, the seller's reaction was swift and customer-focused. They immediately offered to replace the cooler, no questions asked. The next day, they sent someone to deliver a new unit and take back the faulty one.
This level of service went above and beyond my expectations. It was far more convenient than having to ship such a large item myself, which Amazon had initially suggested. The seller's proactive approach, quick resolution, and hassle-free replacement process were truly impressive.

I recommend both this cooler and this seller. The product is efficient and well-designed, and with this level of after-sales support, I couldn't be happier with my purchase. It's refreshing to see a company that stands behind their product and prioritizes customer satisfaction to this degree.

Notably, the ice chamber and cover are constructed from noticeably different plastics, both in texture and color. The chamber boasts a sturdier feel, while the cover feels flimsy and is of a distinctly different hue. This inconsistency in material quality is concerning, particularly for a product of this nature.

Cover Fitment Issues:
The cover's inability to close properly is a recurring annoyance, requiring undue force to secure it in place. Furthermore, its bent appearance near the corners suggests a lack of precision in the manufacturing process, leading to frustration during use.

Mosquito Net Blockage: Examination reveals that portions of the mosquito netting are completely sealed off, raising doubts about the effectiveness of ventilation. Such blockages could impede airflow to the honeycomb pad, potentially compromising the unit's cooling capabilities and placing undue strain on the fan mechanism.

Body Gaps:
Upon closer inspection, it becomes evident that there are multiple areas where the various components of the body fail to align seamlessly. These visible gaps suggest a lack of attention to detail during assembly, detracting from the product's overall aesthetic and functionality.

 Very good product crompton Desert air cooler
Reviewed in India on 8 April 2024
Style Name: 65-LitreVerified Purchase
Very good product crompton.
Air cooler size am not expect this much height .
It's very tall optimus 65 model.
It's suitable for big size hall ....
2 days am used this product ....
Cooling wise it's so wonderful am filling light hot water inside the chamber but output it's give cooling & breeze air .
First day approximately I filled 60-62 ltr water afternoon 1 to evening 8 o clock it's continuously running and comes under min level.

Second day filled 60 LTR water using at night time
9 pm to morning 5 am .
So average 8 hours it's running full tank capacity.

Noise wise quit good . Very pleasant .

First day full of honeycomb smell in hall .
But second day it's not in machine .
So smell so horrible at day 1 . So pls out of children from this cooler day 1.

Before operate & run the aircooler kindly check bottom chamber I identified two screw inside the water chamber.
I dont know how it's happened may be travelling time it may be happen .
So before check water chamber then you run it your cooler.

Note : Water issue area people & metro people
per day it's consump 60 ltr water so cost it around
25*3 water cane = 60 ruppes
60*30 days = 1800 rupees
+
Current bill consumption you add so total it around 2100 RS it's come monthly charge .
So my personal opinion
If you need aircooler for your home think & buy.
If water problem not in your area.
If water problem is there in your area kindly think and buy .

Thankyou

 PLASTIC FAN with ordinary plastic body and cheap workmanship
Reviewed in India on 15 March 2025
Style Name: 100-LitreVerified Purchase
The fan should be always metal. I had upgraded from Ozone 75 to this assuming blindly that the fan would be metal as was with the earlier. The fan is made of plastic and has only 3 wings. My old ozone 75 had 5 metal wings. The plastic was better, and over-all workmanship was good. The plastic here is flimsy and has lots of semi finished parts to it. There are a lot of gaps everywhere, the front grill is having so big gaps that a small kid can easily put his/her hands in as the louvers are way too flexible. Throw is ok, sound is reduced a bit. But thoroughly disappointed. Thought Crompton knew how to make a desert cooler. I guess I should have relied on my local, super trusterd Nagpur cooler vendor, Ram Coolers. Just hoping the motor should be good as I am thinking of changing the fan soon. Hope I can trust Crompton with atleast the fan motors.

NOTE: TV TABLE STAND IS NOT PROVIDED IN THE BOX. No Bluetooth support. Only wifi 2.4ghz is supported, no 5ghz wifi support. PICTURE & AUDIO quality is SUPERB. Supports dolby and hdr.
Buy this Only if u want reliability (samsung displays are very reliable and last long unlike cheap counterparts) , good picture and audio quality.

Bought the bezel less 2022 variant for 14,990 rupees.
Samsung is a reliable brand. Picture & quality is good. Although it's not a full hd 1080p display, at 32 inches its not apparent.

User interface is okay. Netflix app works smooth but prime video app is laggy. Tizen os is fine. So no google play store. Doesn't support chromecast, only supports Mira cast which is a different casting protocol.

Feature wise tizen os is bare minimum. But you can easily buy an android tv box to get google play functionality if u want to run android apps.

Brands like tcl, ifalconn, redmi offer more features because they run google tv\ android tv but their hardware is not reliable.

This samsung 32inches tv is great deal if u buy at 14k inr. Great picture clarity. Good sound quality. HDR works good. Samsung has great after sales customer service. So if u want good quality and reliable TV and don't care too much about having android tv os, go for this. It's a great product.

Product was intact, delivery was smooth. Open box inspection was done. It was delivered to our room where it was to be installed. It had all accessories except wall-top mount/table top, but that was provided by the Samsung , free of cost.
Display, Performance, Remote control all are functioning properly as till date. Picture quality, Sound, etc., are good too. Since it's a HD and Smart TV, the Samsung Engineer installed the Smart App and so, we can see YouTube, Samsung Tv and an other channel or two without making an account, but Netflix, and others need an account for viewing. But his is no problem. Because I purchased it for my parents and they aren't interested in watching those channels at all. The Samsung Tv has 150 channels, starting from 1000. I viewed them one by one. All were good, mostly in English. I am impressed. üëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüòÅüòÅüòÅ
The Samsung Engineer helped us a lot, in other things too, like removing the set-top box stand from one room to fix in their room, and adjusting all wires, audio-visual pins and plugs, etc.. But this was not included in his service, so, we paid him for the extra service, though he was quite reluctant to accept the payment. You know, his service included only in installing Tv and downloading Smart App to start the function. But the other service wasn't included.

 Poor Seller Experience
Reviewed in India on 15 March 2025
Colour: UltramarineSize: 128 GBVerified Purchase
I am writing to formally complain about my recent purchase of an iPhone 16 from online on Amazon.
I received the item on the same day of purchase, but upon unboxing, I noticed that the iPhone came in a mismatched (muddled) box. When I powered it on, the phone was stuck on the ‚ÄúHello‚Äù screen, repeatedly displaying ‚ÄúHello‚Äù in multiple languages. It was completely unresponsive‚Äînone of the buttons, including the power and volume buttons, were functioning.

After approximately five hours, the battery finally drained, and the phone shut down. However, after restarting, the same issue persisted, with the device stuck on the ‚ÄúHello‚Äù screen again.

I contacted Amazon‚Äôs support team, who advised me to reach out to Apple Support. Apple Support suggested some troubleshooting steps, but none resolved the issue. Ultimately, they advised me to visit an Apple-authorized service center for a software reinstallation‚Äîon a brand-new phone.

I then had to travel 5 km to a Maple (Apple-authorized) service center, where they reinstalled the software. The process took about 45‚Äì50 minutes, finally making the phone functional.

I am extremely disappointed with this experience. After purchasing a costly device, I suffered an entire day of inconvenience due to the seller‚Äôs inefficiency or the company‚Äôs negligence in quality control. This is unacceptable, especially for a premium product.

Previously, I had purchased an iPhone 15 online without any issues, but this time, the experience was frustrating and disappointing. I strongly urge you to take action against this seller for supplying what appears to be old or improperly stored stock.

I request appropriate compensation for the inconvenience and mental stress caused. Additionally, I advise other customers to be cautious when purchasing from this seller.

I hope Amazon takes this matter seriously and ensures such incidents do not happen again.

Product is very good but I will suggest if you are paying 13000 and purchasing in online mode then pls pay 2000 more and go offline and buy from shop. They will give you same model but built quality and RAM and ROM will be more updated version. Also remember if you think online and offline products are same then you are wrong.

Size: 32 inches | HD Smart Bezel-less DesignVerified Purchase
NOTE: TV TABLE STAND IS NOT PROVIDED IN THE BOX. No Bluetooth support. Only wifi 2.4ghz is supported, no 5ghz wifi support. PICTURE & AUDIO quality is SUPERB. Supports dolby and hdr.
Buy this Only if u want reliability (samsung displays are very reliable and last long unlike cheap counterparts) , good picture and audio quality.

Bought the bezel less 2022 variant for 14,990 rupees.
Samsung is a reliable brand. Picture & quality is good. Although it's not a full hd 1080p display, at 32 inches its not apparent.

User interface is okay. Netflix app works smooth but prime video app is laggy. Tizen os is fine. So no google play store. Doesn't support chromecast, only supports Mira cast which is a different casting protocol.

Feature wise tizen os is bare minimum. But you can easily buy an android tv box to get google play functionality if u want to run android apps.

Brands like tcl, ifalconn, redmi offer more features because they run google tv\ android tv but their hardware is not reliable.

This samsung 32inches tv is great deal if u buy at 14k inr. Great picture clarity. Good sound quality. HDR works good. Samsung has great after sales customer service. So if u want good quality and reliable TV and don't care too much about having android tv os, go for this. It's a great product.

Product was intact, delivery was smooth. Open box inspection was done. It was delivered to our room where it was to be installed. It had all accessories except wall-top mount/table top, but that was provided by the Samsung , free of cost.
Display, Performance, Remote control all are functioning properly as till date. Picture quality, Sound, etc., are good too. Since it's a HD and Smart TV, the Samsung Engineer installed the Smart App and so, we can see YouTube, Samsung Tv and an other channel or two without making an account, but Netflix, and others need an account for viewing. But his is no problem. Because I purchased it for my parents and they aren't interested in watching those channels at all. The Samsung Tv has 150 channels, starting from 1000. I viewed them one by one. All were good, mostly in English. I am impressed. üëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüòÅüòÅüòÅ
The Samsung Engineer helped us a lot, in other things too, like removing the set-top box stand from one room to fix in their room, and adjusting all wires, audio-visual pins and plugs, etc.. But this was not included in his service, so, we paid him for the extra service, though he was quite reluctant to accept the payment. You know, his service included only in installing Tv and downloading Smart App to start the function. But the other service wasn't included. He did it as kindness towards us, and we paid him as a token of gratitude. With God's Grace, all was done smoothly. Thanks to Lord for providing help in his form. And thanks to dealer and Samsung brand too for providing such service. üëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüôèüôèüôèüôèüôè üíêüíêüíêüíêüíê

 Poor Seller Experience
Reviewed in India on 15 March 2025
Colour: UltramarineSize: 128 GBVerified Purchase
I am writing to formally complain about my recent purchase of an iPhone 16 from online on Amazon.
I received the item on the same day of purchase, but upon unboxing, I noticed that the iPhone came in a mismatched (muddled) box. When I powered it on, the phone was stuck on the ‚ÄúHello‚Äù screen, repeatedly displaying ‚ÄúHello‚Äù in multiple languages. It was completely unresponsive‚Äînone of the buttons, including the power and volume buttons, were functioning.

After approximately five hours, the battery finally drained, and the phone shut down. However, after restarting, the same issue persisted, with the device stuck on the ‚ÄúHello‚Äù screen again.

I contacted Amazon‚Äôs support team, who advised me to reach out to Apple Support. Apple Support suggested some troubleshooting steps, but none resolved the issue. Ultimately, they advised me to visit an Apple-authorized service center for a software reinstallation‚Äîon a brand-new phone.

I then had to travel 5 km to a Maple (Apple-authorized) service center, where they reinstalled the software. The process took about 45‚Äì50 minutes, finally making the phone functional.

I am extremely disappointed with this experience. After purchasing a costly device, I suffered an entire day of inconvenience due to the seller‚Äôs inefficiency or the company‚Äôs negligence in quality control. This is unacceptable, especially for a premium product.

Previously, I had purchased an iPhone 15 online without any issues, but this time, the experience was frustrating and disappointing. I strongly urge you to take action against this seller for supplying what appears to be old or improperly stored stock.

I request appropriate compensation for the inconvenience and mental stress caused. Additionally, I advise other customers to be cautious when purchasing from this seller.

I hope Amazon takes this matter seriously and ensures such incidents do not happen again.

I‚Äôve been using the Noise Pro 6 Max Smart Watch for a few weeks now, and it‚Äôs been a fantastic experience! The 1.96‚Äù AMOLED display is crisp and vibrant, making everything easy to read, even in bright sunlight. The stainless steel build gives it a premium look and feel‚Äîdefinitely a step up from plastic models.

The AI companion is surprisingly responsive, and I love the endless AI watch faces that let me customize the look to match my mood. The built-in GPS is accurate, which makes it perfect for outdoor workouts, and the 5 ATM water resistance gives me peace of mind during workouts and rainy days.

The EN2 Processor ensures smooth performance, with no lag when switching between apps. Plus, it works seamlessly with both iOS and Android devices, which is a huge plus.

Overall, this smartwatch offers great value for money with its advanced features and sleek design. Highly recommended! ‚åöüíØ

 Poor Seller Experience
Reviewed in India on 15 March 2025
Colour: UltramarineSize: 128 GBVerified Purchase
I am writing to formally complain about my recent purchase of an iPhone 16 from online on Amazon.
I received the item on the same day of purchase, but upon unboxing, I noticed that the iPhone came in a mismatched (muddled) box. When I powered it on, the phone was stuck on the ‚ÄúHello‚Äù screen, repeatedly displaying ‚ÄúHello‚Äù in multiple languages. It was completely unresponsive‚Äînone of the buttons, including the power and volume buttons, were functioning.

After approximately five hours, the battery finally drained, and the phone shut down. However, after restarting, the same issue persisted, with the device stuck on the ‚ÄúHello‚Äù screen again.

I contacted Amazon‚Äôs support team, who advised me to reach out to Apple Support. Apple Support suggested some troubleshooting steps, but none resolved the issue. Ultimately, they advised me to visit an Apple-authorized service center for a software reinstallation‚Äîon a brand-new phone.

I then had to travel 5 km to a Maple (Apple-authorized) service center, where they reinstalled the software. The process took about 45‚Äì50 minutes, finally making the phone functional.

I am extremely disappointed with this experience. After purchasing a costly device, I suffered an entire day of inconvenience due to the seller‚Äôs inefficiency or the company‚Äôs negligence in quality control. This is unacceptable, especially for a premium product.

Previously, I had purchased an iPhone 15 online without any issues, but this time, the experience was frustrating and disappointing. I strongly urge you to take action against this seller for supplying what appears to be old or improperly stored stock.

I request appropriate compensation for the inconvenience and mental stress caused. Additionally, I advise other customers to be cautious when purchasing from this seller.

I hope Amazon takes this matter seriously and ensures such incidents do not happen again.

NOTE: TV TABLE STAND IS NOT PROVIDED IN THE BOX. No Bluetooth support. Only wifi 2.4ghz is supported, no 5ghz wifi support. PICTURE & AUDIO quality is SUPERB. Supports dolby and hdr.
Buy this Only if u want reliability (samsung displays are very reliable and last long unlike cheap counterparts) , good picture and audio quality.

Bought the bezel less 2022 variant for 14,990 rupees.
Samsung is a reliable brand. Picture & quality is good. Although it's not a full hd 1080p display, at 32 inches its not apparent.

User interface is okay. Netflix app works smooth but prime video app is laggy. Tizen os is fine. So no google play store. Doesn't support chromecast, only supports Mira cast which is a different casting protocol.

Feature wise tizen os is bare minimum. But you can easily buy an android tv box to get google play functionality if u want to run android apps.

Brands like tcl, ifalconn, redmi offer more features because they run google tv\ android tv but their hardware is not reliable.

This samsung 32inches tv is great deal if u buy at 14k inr. Great picture clarity. Good sound quality. HDR works good. Samsung has great after sales customer service. So if u want good quality and reliable TV and don't care too much about having android tv os, go for this. It's a great product.

Product was intact, delivery was smooth. Open box inspection was done. It was delivered to our room where it was to be installed. It had all accessories except wall-top mount/table top, but that was provided by the Samsung , free of cost.
Display, Performance, Remote control all are functioning properly as till date. Picture quality, Sound, etc., are good too. Since it's a HD and Smart TV, the Samsung Engineer installed the Smart App and so, we can see YouTube, Samsung Tv and an other channel or two without making an account, but Netflix, and others need an account for viewing. But his is no problem. Because I purchased it for my parents and they aren't interested in watching those channels at all. The Samsung Tv has 150 channels, starting from 1000. I viewed them one by one. All were good, mostly in English. I am impressed. üëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüòÅüòÅüòÅ

Crompton Optimus 100 Litres Desert Air Cooler for home,"	Prabal
5.0 out of 5 stars
 5 Stars - Excellent Product and Exceptional Customer Service!
Reviewed in India on 27 June 2024
Style Name: 65-LitreVerified Purchase
I recently purchased the Crompton Optimus Desert Air Cooler (65L) and I'm thoroughly impressed with both the product and the seller's service.

Product Review:
The cooler is well-built with high-quality plastic that feels durable. The honeycomb pads are highly effective, efficiently cooling the room without excessive noise. A standout feature is the ice chamber conveniently located at the top, which enhances the cooling effect.
Initially, I encountered a minor issue with water distribution to the honeycomb pads. However, this leads me to the most impressive part of my experience - the customer service.

Seller Service:
When I shared the issue during their follow-up for a review, the seller's reaction was swift and customer-focused. They immediately offered to replace the cooler, no questions asked. The next day, they sent someone to deliver a new unit and take back the faulty one.
This level of service went above and beyond my expectations. It was far more convenient than having to ship such a large item myself, which Amazon had initially suggested. The seller's proactive approach, quick resolution, and hassle-free replacement process were truly impressive.

I recommend both this cooler and this seller. The product is efficient and well-designed, and with this level of after-sales support, I couldn't be happier with my purchase. It's refreshing to see a company that stands behind their product and prioritizes customer satisfaction to this degree.

Plastic Material Discrepancy:
Notably, the ice chamber and cover are constructed from noticeably different plastics, both in texture and color. The chamber boasts a sturdier feel, while the cover feels flimsy and is of a distinctly different hue. This inconsistency in material quality is concerning, particularly for a product of this nature.

Cover Fitment Issues:
The cover's inability to close properly is a recurring annoyance, requiring undue force to secure it in place. Furthermore, its bent appearance near the corners suggests a lack of precision in the manufacturing process, leading to frustration during use.

Mosquito Net Blockage: Examination reveals that portions of the mosquito netting are completely sealed off, raising doubts about the effectiveness of ventilation. Such blockages could impede airflow to the honeycomb pad, potentially compromising the unit's cooling capabilities and placing undue strain on the fan mechanism.

Body Gaps:
Upon closer inspection, it becomes evident that there are multiple areas where the various components of the body fail to align seamlessly. These visible gaps suggest a lack of attention to detail during assembly, detracting from the product's overall aesthetic and functionality.

 Very good product crompton Desert air cooler
Reviewed in India on 8 April 2024
Style Name: 65-LitreVerified Purchase
Very good product crompton.
Air cooler size am not expect this much height .
It's very tall optimus 65 model.
It's suitable for big size hall ....
2 days am used this product ....
Cooling wise it's so wonderful am filling light hot water inside the chamber but output it's give cooling & breeze air .
First day approximately I filled 60-62 ltr water afternoon 1 to evening 8 o clock it's continuously running and comes under min level.

Second day filled 60 LTR water using at night time
9 pm to morning 5 am .
So average 8 hours it's running full tank capacity.

Noise wise quit good . Very pleasant .

First day full of honeycomb smell in hall .
But second day it's not in machine .
So smell so horrible at day 1 . So pls out of children from this cooler day 1.

Before operate & run the aircooler kindly check bottom chamber I identified two screw inside the water chamber.
I dont know how it's happened may be travelling time it may be happen .
So before check water chamber then you run it your cooler.

Note : Water issue area people & metro people
per day it's consump 60 ltr water so cost it around
25*3 water cane = 60 ruppes
60*30 days = 1800 rupees
+
Current bill consumption you add so total it around 2100 RS it's come monthly charge .
So my personal opinion
If you need aircooler for your home think & buy.
If water problem not in your area.
If water problem is there in your area kindly think and buy .

Thankyou

 PLASTIC FAN with ordinary plastic body and cheap workmanship
Reviewed in India on 15 March 2025
Style Name: 100-LitreVerified Purchase
The fan should be always metal. I had upgraded from Ozone 75 to this assuming blindly that the fan would be metal as was with the earlier. The fan is made of plastic and has only 3 wings. My old ozone 75 had 5 metal wings. The plastic was better, and over-all workmanship was good. The plastic here is flimsy and has lots of semi finished parts to it. There are a lot of gaps everywhere, the front grill is having so big gaps that a small kid can easily put his/her hands in as the louvers are way too flexible. Throw is ok, sound is reduced a bit. But thoroughly disappointed. Thought Crompton knew how to make a desert cooler. I guess I should have relied on my local, super trusterd Nagpur cooler vendor, Ram Coolers. Just hoping the motor should be good as I am thinking of changing the fan soon. Hope I can trust Crompton with atleast the fan motors.

 LG 335 L 3 Star - GL-T372JDS3 - Good Model

Exchange facility
Amazon exchange facility is much better than Flipkart. For the same old fridge (which was 17 yrs old but in good working condition), Flipkart refused to accept saying there are a few (minor) rust marks at bottom of door whereas Amazon accepted without any fuss.

Price
After researching on various 335ltr models, decided on this one due to features and price. Bought on 24-Oct-20 for a effective price of INR 27,500 after exchange, discounts and card cashback.

Delivery & Installation
The new fridge was delivered in good condition without any scratch or damage. Since I was without a fridge when the new one was delivered at 12pm (old taken away in exchange), the LG technician accepted my request to come the same day (at 4pm) and install the new one. I am thankful for this excellent gesture on his part.

Pros
The fridge area is spacious and feels bigger than the earlier LG 390 ltrs model which I was using. This is becos of the more shelves in this model. The pull out tray and the convertible box (above the veg bin) are very useful. The cooling at mid settings is good. The external look in very elegant. The build quality is very good and the fridge has sturdy look overall.

Cons
The vegetable / fruit storage bin at the bottom seems constricted in size and does not move freely. The inside area of freezer compartment also seems smaller as compared to the view from outside. The ice trays / storage occupy much space. No light in the freezer - not sure why LG does not install (even my 17 yr old did not have) inspite of its usefulness and every review mentioning this as a drawback. The user manual is very basic and does not explain the high / low feature in the convertible box / veg bin.

Overall
Though the cons look more, they are not so significant as compared to the good features. I am satisfied with this model and will recommend it.

 The wooooooooorsst company
Reviewed in India on 17 March 2025
Colour: Dazzle SteelVerified Purchase
I got damaged product and I placed for return, I‚Äôm not blaming LG company, from the LG, everything is fine, I‚Äôm talking about the delhivery company, it took nearly half a month to pickup a product, the wooooooorst agent and the wooooorst company, to delivery a refrigerator, only one person is it enough? But Amazon apps says two people will come to deliver. Before signing any contract, Amazon have to do background check up, Now a days every company doing background check up, for a small small postions. I think this company don‚Äôt even have an application where the agent can send a pic of the Customer building, so that it confirms he or she visited the customer location, they gave another option like contact was made but unable to reach customer, wooooow amazing, if he made a contact to the customer, this company app should witness the customer number, in this way should confirm, because of I‚Äôm staying in 2nd floor, they don‚Äôt want to deliver on the floor, then why Amazon accepting the order, if they are charging for the 2nd, 1st floor separately, we are ok to pay but this a wooooorst company where only one person delivering the refrigerator. What if the senior citizens staying on 2nd floor.
After reading this review people will think that , it‚Äôs not a company mistake, it‚Äôs mistake of agents.
Woooooooow
Keeping this I have asked few questions with agents he said, company only saying that not to deliver the product on the 2nd floor separately, deliver on ground floor, it doesn‚Äôt matter where they are staying.
From this I understood, company thinking about money not about growing in the future.
So, Amazon has open their eyes, think once again to do business with this wooooorst company.

Thank you.

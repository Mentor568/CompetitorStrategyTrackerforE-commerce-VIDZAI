Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6,"Please dont buy this product. I had it purchased for Rs 11000. Within a month the display became non functional which was replaced. After 2 months again the screen becomes non responsive. There was no physical damage. Samsungs authorized service center is the worst and they have found an imaginary scratch and says the damage might be due to this and are not honoring the warranty.
It is a horrible experience. The phone is nothing special and is nowhere near the iphones of past 4 years. Please donot buy this product, It is just a fancy item.",Amazon
Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6,"I bought flip 5 from store. I have got the screen replaced once and to pay 30k, as they said it got weird colors on the folding line because of a dent.
I have started seeing again a green light on the flip line, even when phone has not fallen.
It is too fragile to be handled. Also, of it is so fragile, they should share handling instructions as phone is bound to fall at times",Amazon
Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6,"Don't fall for shine and cuteness of flip, its screen got unresponsive within two months, when I visited service center, I was told it is very delicate piece and requires child like care. No one says so while at the time of sale in in advance, what is the point of a phone if it cannot be kept in pocket or used. Worst money spent",Amazon

Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6,"Samsung has been on the epitome in smartphone market since very long and it is clearly seen in the quality of this product.
Battery stays for the day with moderate usage. Only Superfast charging (25W) is supported and not Superfast 2.0 (45W) like S24 Ultra series.

Camera preview on the rear screen is the most used feature by me and because of Nice Camera Quality, it outshines other phones in this range.",Amazon
Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6,"I have been using various samsung fones from Note series to S series to humble M or A. My son is apple guy and has latest Phone. BUT fold6 is THE BEST! It's a beast! Seriously! The only cons is camera quality that should have been better, but otherwise this is superb! The processing, speed, split screen, editing. AI...the list is endless. Plus the admiration and attention otherwise gets in large screen is worth the money! Btw, there is gst added to interest for emi option that makes the fone a lot more expensive then the emi mentioned. Unfortunately that is not clearly mentioned while purchasing.",Amazon
Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6,"I bought this phone just a month ago for my wife. She was so cautious that she did not even want to use it before we got a Cover for it. She uses her phone for both personal and office related work. It was working fine for the first 2-3 weeks, but since a week she started complaining that the screen is freezing. It does not respond at all. This kept repeating again and again at least 15-20 times a day over the last couple of days. We tried multiple things like waiting for a little while, clearing the cache, closing all apps and finally hard booting if required. But today morning, the screen did not respond even after hard booting. We are able to use the limited features that are accessible on the small screen on the top, but the main screen did not work. we finally took it to the authorized service center and to our surprise, they could not replicate the problem there. The moment we left that place and came home, the same problem re-started again. We had to go back to the service center and they said they'll have to reinstall the OS to fix the issue. I hope they'll be able to fix it for good before returning it to us.

However, my concern is that a phone that costs ~1.2 Lakhs crashing like this within a month of buying it, is completely unacceptable. We do not have any 3rd party apps installed, no physical damage or any other things that we can think of that could cause this kind of an issue. I have been a loyal Android user and Samsung is supposed to be producing the best of the Android devices in the market. I am absolutely disappointed by this experience.

Update: At the Service center, they diagnosed that it was a hardware issue and had to replace the touchscreen. For some reason they also replaced the battery. I still don't understand what the battery had to do with the touch screen not working. I hope the issue is fixed for good now. Nevertheless. I am really disappointed with this incident. I feel like we are using a refurbished phone and not a new one though we paid for a new one!",Amazon

Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max,"Excellent phone, Apple Intelligence is amazing, the battery life is mind blowing and comes with the best camera. If you have a 13 Pro Max or older, go for it. If you have a 14 Pro Max, the only difference you are going to see is Apple Intelligence, better battery life and slightly better cameras. Otherwise it's going to feel like the exact same phone if you use it without a case as the rounded eges in 16 Pro Max are better to use without cases. Skip and save money if you have the 15 Pro Max because the difference is negligible. The black titanium color looks gorgeous and the only good color in the current series. It's a shame they removed the Blue Titanium color. Also costs 15-20k less than the launch price of 15 Pro Max so that is a huge plus.",Amazon

OnePlus 13,"***** A True Flagship Experience! *****

I recently got my hands on the OnePlus 13, and I must say, this phone is a game-changer. OnePlus has truly outdone itself this time. Here's why:

Design & Build
The sleek design is stunning and feels premium in hand. The finish on the back resists fingerprints, and the phone is surprisingly lightweight yet solid. It's definitely a head-turner!

Display
The AMOLED display is gorgeous, with vibrant colors and buttery-smooth 120Hz refresh rate. Watching videos and gaming feels incredibly immersive, even under bright sunlight.

Performance
Powered by the latest Snapdragon chipset, the phone is a beast! Multitasking is seamless, and gaming performance is top-notch with zero lags. Apps open in an instant, and the overall performance feels lightning-fast.

Software
The OxygenOS experience is clean and intuitive. The new customizations and smooth animations make the Ulleven more enjoyable.

Verdict
If you're looking for a flagship phone that combines cutting-edge performance, stunning design, and an incredible camera, the OnePlus 13 is the one to get. It's worth every penny and outshines most competitors in its price range.",Amazon
OnePlus 13,"Oneplus has outdone themselves with this phone!

The phone is best in all categories.
I'm loving it's stunning display, it's superb Camera which compares and performs better than the iphone 15 pro Max (have compared and the iphone user agrees!), the super powerful battery and the INSANE battery life! (check the attached image). It also gets charged super duper fast! Takes about 30-35 minutes to go from 10-100% and then I hardly ever seen the need to charge it in the next 1-1.5 days. At best cases, it even lasts whole 2 days+

It also has a really premium feeling. I got the beautiful white one, 16+512gb variant.

The Oxygen OS 15 is really fluid and butter smooth. Feels very refined. Speakers are great for audio output in rooms (hall, bedroom etc)

Honestly, coming from OP6 (which itself was a legandary) after ~6.5+ years, THIS IS THE UPGRADE I could ever ask for!

Oh and the AI photo editor works like charm. So does the circle to search. Haven't had chance to test other features yet but I feel like the device will really live upto the feeling so far.

Amazing work Oneplus!",Amazon

OnePlus 13,"OnePlus don't want me to get settled with other smartphone üòÇüçéüì±in past i have used the iphone 15 plus for just 3 months.. Then again

B) Cons

1) Camera - Not upto the Mark
2) Laggy Zoom ( camera ) while switching lences ( not even close to the iphone, iPhone is the best for smooth camera zoom/lence switching )
3) Sound Quality - just feeling like I'm using 15-20k device, in past OnePlus given dolby atmos for their devices until OnePlus 12 ,but now they are giving OReality audio ( which is too bad )
compared with iPhone15, our OnePlus is far away from the compitition.
4) Notification delay for instagram.( can be fixed )
5) Build quality not feels Premium.
6) Price Tag - it should be available for 50k to 60k",Amazon

OnePlus 13,"I been a one plus fan since the one plus 5. Yes that's almost 8 years now and i been noticing the downgrade since the plus9. The box is way smaller, the cable and the charger quality is worse. They changed the transparent cover with some black cover that hides the phone color.
These things i can live with however my last plus phone (9) had an issue where the slider would open the search window in browsers or YouTube and it was pretty annoying. Problem was not all phones had this issue and one plus stopped caring about the phone once the 10 came out.

Now i got my oneplus 13 and i thought they should have fixed things by now right? Oh hey, what's that? Photos in apps are distorted, not all apps but only some. I msged them oneplus forum and their solution was to format the phone which did not fix the issue. Now i have to use this phone for the next 3-5 years stuck with a problem that they will probably not solve since they will be busy with 14 and 15.",Amazon

Apple Watch Series 9,"Old but precise. That is how I would describe it. Old as in the packaging i got was quite dirty. But the product inside was fine and works very good. The only issue I find for this watch is the location service. It does not quite have the fast location service but nevertheless, looks and feels very nice.",Amazon
Apple Watch Series 9,Excellent watch with very good battery life. Apple watches get booted and paired very fast. UI is buttery smooth. Lack of direct WhatsApp App is a bit disappointing. Apart from that a must have watch for Apple users. Go for Silver as you can switch different colored bands with it :),Amazon
Apple Watch Series 9,"The Apple Watch Series 9 emerges as a shining example of innovation and forward-thinking in the realm of smartwatches. With its brighter, more powerful screen and the introduction of the Double Tap gesture, it stands out as a significant leap forward in user interaction1. The new S9 chipset not only enhances performance but also paves the way for a more eco-friendly approach to technology.

One of the most talked-about features is the Double Tap gesture, which promises to revolutionize the way we interact with our devices on a daily basis1. It‚Äôs a delightful addition that enhances the overall user experience. Moreover, the watch‚Äôs commitment to sustainability is commendable, with its shift towards environmentally friendly materials and its status as the first carbon-neutral Apple device2.

While it maintains the classic design we‚Äôve come to love, the Series 9 doesn‚Äôt shy away from introducing new technologies such as the Ultra Wideband (UWB) radio technology. This not only improves device finding capabilities but also ensures that the watch is future-proof, ready to embrace upcoming features developed for UWB-capable devices1.

In conclusion, the Apple Watch Series 9 is not just a smartwatch; it‚Äôs a statement of where technology can take us when it‚Äôs designed with both the user and the environment in mind. It‚Äôs the perfect companion for those who want the best of Apple‚Äôs smartwatch capabilities, wrapped up in a device that‚Äôs both powerful and responsible.",Amazon
Apple Watch Series 9,"Got my first apple watch. It was pricy and i got good discount. Battery last for 3 days. Accuracy is fine, ease of use would be considered if you get accustomed to it. Display is great. Quality is fine and could have beem even better at this price range",Amazon
Apple Watch Series 9,"This is the first time after much speculations and weighing all the other options I decided to buy an Apple Watch.
I‚Äôve been using it for last two months and it‚Äôs flawless.
It has every feature, and of course, using it with iPhone or iPad Makes it very easy to use .
The best part about the watch is it‚Äôs connectivity, gestures, of course.
It‚Äôs battery life is very good. I have to charge once in one and a half day and that‚Äôs all ,it last for long, given that it is connected with Wi-Fi whole time.
It charges very quickly.
When it comes to appearance, I ordered 41 MM, it comes with sports strap band which is really good quality, only if somebody wants a different strap then you can purchase separately otherwise, no need at all.
Separately, I ordered a protector and a screen guard.

If somebody is looking for new Apple Watch who has never used it, this money is worth, but I‚Äôve heard that people already have previous series watches then there is no point in upgrading. I‚Äôve heard that it is pretty much same but for new investment this is Best latest. 10 on 10.",Amazon

Apple MacBook Air Laptop,"‚ÄúI‚Äôve been using the MacBook M2 with 16GB RAM and 256GB storage for a while now, and it‚Äôs an absolute beast! üî•

Performance: The M2 chip is a game-changer. It handles everything I throw at it, from multitasking with heavy apps like Final Cut Pro and Photoshop to running virtual machines effortlessly. There‚Äôs zero lag, even with multiple tabs and applications open simultaneously.

Battery Life: The efficiency of the M2 chip paired with macOS is incredible. I easily get 10+ hours of battery life on a single charge, which makes it perfect for working on the go.

Build Quality: As expected from Apple, the build is premium. The sleek design, lightweight form factor, and stunning Retina display with vibrant colors make this laptop a joy to use every day.

Storage: While 256GB might seem limited for some, the speed of the SSD makes up for it. Apps launch instantly, and file transfers are blazing fast. For those who need more storage, external SSDs or cloud storage work seamlessly with the system.

Verdict: If you‚Äôre looking for a laptop that delivers on performance, portability, and battery life, the MacBook M2 is unbeatable in its class. Whether you‚Äôre a creative professional, a coder, or a student, this machine will not disappoint. Highly recommend!‚Äù

Whether I'm working out, commuting, or simply relaxing, they stay in place without causing any discomfort.

Noise Cancellation and Transparency Mode:
The active noise cancellation is incredibly effective, creating a serene listening environment even in bustling surroundings. On the flip side, the Transparency Mode is a genius addition, allowing me to stay aware of my surroundings without removing the earbuds. It's like having control over my auditory environment.

Build Quality and Design:
As expected from Apple, the build quality is impeccable. The sleek and compact charging case is not only aesthetically pleasing but also practical for on-the-go use. The touch controls on the earbuds are responsive and intuitive, adding to the overall user-friendly design.

Battery Life:
The battery life is impressive. With the case providing multiple charges, I rarely find myself needing to plug them in. The quick charge feature is a lifesaver, giving me hours of use with just a short charge.

Integration with Apple Ecosystem:
The seamless integration with the Apple ecosystem is a standout feature. From automatic device pairing to Siri integration, the AirPods Pro seamlessly integrate with my iPhone, iPad, and Mac, enhancing the overall user experience.

In conclusion, the Apple AirPods Pro (2nd Generation) are a masterpiece of audio technology. They combine unparalleled sound quality, comfort, and advanced features in a sleek and sophisticated package. While they may be an investment, the enhanced listening experience and convenience make them worth every penny. I wholeheartedly recommend the AirPods Pro to anyone in search of the ultimate wireless earbud experience.",Amazon
Apple AirPods Pro (2nd Generation),"As an avid music lover and tech enthusiast, I recently had the opportunity to test the AirPods Pro, and I must say, they exceeded my expectations in every way possible. Apple's flagship wireless earbuds have truly set a new standard for premium audio and convenience.

Design and Comfort:
The first thing that caught my attention was the sleek and compact design of the AirPods Pro. The in-ear form factor with customizable silicone tips ensures a secure and comfortable fit, making them ideal for long listening sessions without causing discomfort. Additionally, the Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) feature effectively blocks out external noises, allowing me to immerse myself in the music.

Audio Quality:
When it comes to audio quality, the AirPods Pro truly shine. The sound is incredibly crisp, with well-balanced mids, clear highs, and punchy bass. Whether I'm listening to classical symphonies or grooving to the latest hip-hop tracks, the AirPods Pro deliver an impressive audio experience that remains unparalleled in the true wireless earbud market.

Transparency Mode:
One standout feature that impressed me was the Transparency Mode. With a simple press, I could instantly switch from ANC to Transparency Mode, which allowed me to stay aware of my surroundings without removing the earbuds. This feature came in handy during outdoor activities, ensuring my safety while still enjoying my music.

Noise-Canceling:
The AirPods Pro's Active Noise Cancellation is hands down one of the best I've experienced. It effectively eliminates background noise, making them perfect for busy commutes or when I need to focus in a noisy environment. It significantly enhances the overall listening experience, helping me get lost in my favorite tunes without distractions.

Battery Life and Wireless Charging:
While the battery life of the AirPods Pro is not exceptionally long, it is adequate for most daily use. With ANC enabled, I consistently got around 4.5 to 5 hours of continuous playback, which is quite impressive considering the active noise-canceling feature. The wireless charging case is also a convenient addition, providing multiple charges on the go without the hassle of cables.

Connectivity and Controls:
Pairing the AirPods Pro with my Apple devices was seamless and hassle-free. Once paired, they automatically connect to the device whenever I open the case. The touch controls on the earbuds are responsive and intuitive, allowing me to control music playback, answer calls, and access Siri effortlessly.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, the AirPods Pro is a top-of-the-line true wireless earbud offering from Apple that delivers outstanding audio quality, comfort, and cutting-edge features. From the moment I put them on, I was blown away by the immersive audio experience and the convenience they provided. If you are looking for the best wireless earbuds on the market, the AirPods Pro should undoubtedly be at the top of your list.",Amazon
Apple AirPods Pro (2nd Generation),"Finally got my hands on the Apple AirPods Pro (2nd Gen) and I'm happy that the product is 100% genuine. The sound quality and immersive audio experience have truly impressed me. The Noise Cancellation feature surpasses any other competitor in the market (obviously), and it stays snugly in my ear even during intense workouts at the gym.

All in all, I'm quite satisfied with the product (so far). The only minor drawback I'd say is that the audio bass could be a bit stronger. Still, the audio quality, the features, the battery life, and the overall fit make it a perfect travel companion.",Amazon

Redmi Note 13 Pro,"I've been using the Redmi Note 13 Pro Plus for a week now, and I must say, it's exceeded my expectations in almost every department! The phone's performance is lightning-fast, thanks to the powerful processor and ample RAM. The display is stunning, with vibrant colors and crisp visuals. Battery life is impressive, easily lasting a day with heavy usage. Cameras are top-notch, capturing detailed photos and videos. The design is sleek and premium, with a comfortable grip. Call quality is top notch, even in low network areas.
Cons: software and security update as given are for 03 years and 04 years respectively, they could have offered for more like for 05 years, though the phone came with Hyper OS and Android 14 out of th the box, comparing to the initial phone which came with MIUI 14 and Android 13. It will be a long wait to see how many updates i will be getting.
Other only minor gripe is the lack of wireless charging, but that's a small trade-off for the incredible value this phone offers. Overall, I'm thoroughly enjoying my Redmi Note 13 Pro Plus experience and would highly recommend it to anyone seeking a high-performance device without breaking the bank. My review - A premium package on a mid range budget.",Amazon
Redmi Note 13 Pro,"First of all let's go with the pros
Display: the best thing I liked about this device is it's display am first time using an amoled curved display and it's soo good it's super smooth with 120hz and the colors are good too and within a week this device fall from about 6 feet and 3-4 times and there was not even a scratch it shows the victus protection does it's job well
‚Ä¢ some of the users claim that the 120 watts is not working it's taking about 50 mins but actually if you try to charge the device out of the box it will shows that 120w quick charge but you need to go to settings>battery and switch on the boost charging then only it gives you true 120w potential in 19 mins
‚Ä¢ I had test the device dipped in water for 15 mins and still there is no issues found so the ip68 also works good
‚Ä¢ And i got and update from miui to xiaomi hyperos
And the ui is also super smooth without any bugs found
‚Ä¢ and about gaming the device gives a smooth experience I played freefire in max settings in high fps and still I got about 50fps and i tried e-football ect.. And the device heats up a bit still not overheating in gaming I didn't found any shutters or lags it works smooth
Cons:
I think this stuff is a bit overpriced
The camera is not up to the mark in these price range
But still it can be fixed with a software update
And the battery drains fast I don't think it's 5000 mah my 5 yrs old vivo gives more backup than this but still 120w just full in 19 mins
And the other features are good about these device the cons can be just fixed by an update and after all i love these phone don't mind the negative comments just go for it and i have a suggestion it's bit over priced so you can buy it on offer times and it's not an performance oriented device if you are a gamer or looking that types of phne you can go for iqoo neo 9 Or something and that's all about these device I think this review may help you and i I'll update if I faced any prblms thank youüòä",Amazon
Redmi Note 13 Pro,"I've been using the Redmi Note 13 Pro+ for a while now, and I have to say, it's an amazing phone, especially for the price. Here‚Äôs why I love it:

Design and Feel:
First off, it looks and feels premium. The sleek design and solid build make it feel way more expensive than it actually is. It's comfortable to hold and use, which is a big plus.

Display:
The screen is gorgeous. The AMOLED display is bright and vibrant, making everything from videos to games look fantastic. Plus, the high refresh rate makes scrolling and animations super smooth.

Performance:
Even though it has a weaker processor compared to other upper mid-range smartphones, the performance is still really good. Apps open quickly, and multitasking is a breeze. I‚Äôve played some pretty graphics-heavy games on it, and it handles them surprisingly well.

Camera:
The camera setup is really impressive. Photos come out clear and vibrant, even in low light. The extra lenses for wide-angle shots and close-ups add a lot of versatility. It‚Äôs perfect for snapping great photos on the go.

Battery Life:
Battery life is solid. It easily lasts all day with heavy use, and the fast charging is a lifesaver when you‚Äôre in a hurry. No more waiting around for your phone to charge!

Software:
HyperOs is smooth and feature-packed. It takes a bit to get used to if you‚Äôre coming from another brand, but it‚Äôs intuitive and has a lot of useful features.

Overall, the Redmi Note 13 Pro+ is a fantastic choice if you want a high-quality phone without spending a fortune. It delivers great performance, a beautiful display, and a top-notch camera all at an affordable price. Definitely recommend it!

Bonus: There's no heating issue observed when doing demanding tasks!",Amazon

I got it for one of the female members of the family. Was initially skeptical about the genuinity reading other's comments but it turned out well. Relevant details below.

1. Long-lasting kajal pencil with long kajal lead.
2. Smudge-free application. Unlike local kajal, it does not smudge much after application.
3. Rotate to extend kajal lead prevents wastage as is the case with wooden kajal pencil where you need to sharpen it. Lots of kajal is wasted with the sharpener.
4. One pencil may last for months based on moderate usage.
5. Dual pencil pack with extra savings.
6. Kajal is waterproof & safe for eyes.

Again, as i always say. Be proactive and research well before ordering from any seller to avoid the issues. Check seller ratings, Amazon fulfilled tag, etc. Not every seller here is there to dupe you. They too source material from retailers and wholesalers.

And if you are unfortunate, contact Amazon with your issue. Its mentioned on the website ""This item isn't eligible for return. However, if you've received a damaged, defective, or different item, you may contact us for the next steps.""
But since this product is directly non-returnable due to its nature, be proactive and avoid troubles in the first place.

One thing that may help everyone is to make a video while opening any item received. This will act as proof (in case there's an issue) that it was sent to you that way while making a request to the care person. A minute video can save you troubles later on.

‚ñ∂ In my case pencil was intact with no damage to kajal lead or outer casing. Also, it's the same as the one sourced from the local shop. I have attached genuine hologram pics to compare. The fake ones have a different hologram.

1. Small lettered LAKME written all over horizontally.
2. Central region had the 3D effect of a hemisphere with LAKME written on top and bigger font EYE CO NIC written in 3 separate lines.
3. A big L visible in the central region surrounding hemisphere.
4. Pacman type figure covering two sides of L in point 3.
5. The hologram is under lamination and so is not removable.

If you don't find the above characteristics, don't even open it from the back and contact Amazon.

‚ñ∂ A genuine hologram is authentic because its exact design is not at all easily reproducible. One needs the costly master die to reproduce the hologram while hologram manufacturers do not manufacture any brand-specific die or hologram without sufficient documentation authenticating the ownership of the brand name.
